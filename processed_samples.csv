""" Best Barclays business credit cards Barclays offers four co-branded business credit cards that can help small business owners earn rewards on their travel purchases. Each caters to a specific travel partner: American Airlines, JetBlue, Hawaiian Airlines, and Wyndham Hotels.

Pros You’ll earn loyalty points towards AAdvantage elite status through your spending on the card. AAdvantage miles can be used to book partner awards within the oneworld Alliance and 8 other airlines, often at better rates. Cons AAdvantage miles are subject to availability and can be dynamically priced, making ideal redemptions more challenging to find. It's unclear when this card will be available for new applications. Best for JetBlue loyalists: JetBlue Business Card BR score: 3.4 Bankrate’s view The JetBlue Business Card is an ideal card for frequent flyers and has solid everyday categories. It has a $99 annual fee and earns 6X JetBlue TrueBlue points on JetBlue purchases, 2X points on restaurant and office supply purchases and 1X points on all other purchases. The welcome offer is worth up to 60,000 bonus points. Cardholders earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in the first 90 days of account opening and an additional 10,000 bonus points after making a purchase on an employee card. Your points won’t expire and can be redeemed for Hawaiian Airlines or Qatar Airways flights. In addition, JetBlue TrueBlue lets you pool points with up to 7 friends and family members to help make the most of your rewards. Your spending also counts towards earning Mosaic status , which can lead to upgrades, free drinks and more points. Pros You’ll earn bonus miles on your anniversary which can help offset the annual fee. The card gives you a rebate when using you use points for JetBlue-operated flights. Cons Earning Mosaic status purely through spending has a high spending requirement. The card's bonus category earning rates outside JetBlue purchases are mediocre compared to other travel cards. Best for frequent Hawaiian Airlines travelers: Hawaiian Airlines® World Elite Business Mastercard® BR score: 4.1 Bankrate’s view For a $99 annual fee, this card earns 3X miles on eligible Hawaiian Airlines purchases, 2X miles on gas, dining and office supply store purchases and 1X miles on all other purchases. The card comes with a solid welcome offer of up to 70,000 HawaiianMiles , earning 60,000 miles after spending $2,000 within the first 90 days of account opening, plus an additional 10,000 miles after a purchase is made on an employee card in that timeframe. You’ll get a one-time 50 percent companion discount, anniversary bonus miles based on spending, no foreign transaction fees, and you can share miles with friends and family with no transfer fee. You can also book 5 different partner airlines with HawaiianMiles. Pros The spending requirement for the high-value welcome offer is reasonable. The ability to share your miles with others offers strong redemption flexibility. Cons The companion discount is only valid for flights in Hawaii and North America, limiting flexibility. Earning anniversary bonus miles requires high annual spending. Best for Wyndham Hotels stays: Wyndham Rewards Earner® Business Card BR score: 3.1 Bankrate’s view This card earns 8X Wyndham Rewards points at Hotels by Wyndham and gas stations, 5X for eligible marketing, advertising and utility purchases, and 1X on all other purchases. The limited-time welcome offer is elevated to up to 100,000 points. You’ll earn 50,000 after spending $4,000 in the first 90 days and another 50,000 for sending $15,000 within the first 12 months. For a $95 annual fee, you’ll get automatic top-level Diamond status, booking discounts, and no foreign transaction fees. This card also has the strongest bonus category rate of all Barclays business cards with the gas category. Pros This card earns one of the best rates on gas station purchases. Automatic Diamond status and booking discounts provide extra value for frequent Wyndham stays. Cons Earning rates outside the bonus categories are poor compared to other travel cards. Diamond status with Wyndham doesn’t provide as much value as top-tier status at other hotel brands. How to choose the best Barclays business card Barclays business credit cards are co-branded travel cards , which makes them less flexible than standard travel rewards business cards . Their perks largely focus on travel, though theyall offer standard business perks like complimentary employee cards and expense management. If you don’t typically travel with one of these brands, you should look for a business card that aligns better with your needs and spending habits. But if you travel with one or several of these companies,  consider the following factors to choose a card that works best for your business: Compare reward values. According to our points and miles valuations, HawaiianMiles are worth 0.7 cents, Wyndham Rewards are worth 0.9 cents, AAdvantage miles are worth 1.0 cents, and JetBlue TrueBlue points are worth up to 1.3 cents on average. These numbers can help you better visualize the overall value of your points. For example, earning 8X Wyndham points on a gas purchase is worth a minimum 7.2 percent return, with the potential for more value depending on how you redeem. Evaluate your travel preferences. Since Barclays only offers co-branded business cards, it makes sense to consider one that aligns with your typical travel preferences. If you regularly fly with American Airlines, you're unlikely to get better value from the JetBlue card even though its points are worth more on average. . Weigh the benefits: See if the card you choose offers cardholder perks you’re interested in, especially if they can benefit your business.

Some provide instant value while others require significant spending to unlock. You’ll need to decide how much spending makes the most sense for your business when it comes to maximizing rewards. Bonus categories Make your spending decisions wisely based on your needs. The best way to maximize spending on any card is to use bonus categories to earn additional points. The most obvious way to do that with Barclays business cards is to spend money on purchases from your card's airline or hotel brand. You’ll generally get the best rates on those purchases with co-branded cards. While you can usually get better rates on the other bonus categories with other cards or programs, there are exceptions, notably on the Wyndham card. The rate for gas stations is one of the highest available, and the 5X categories offer solid returns in typically non-bonused categories. Most people have utility bills, so using that card is one of the few options to earn better than flat-rate bonuses on those expenses. The other bonus categories are geared toward business spending in categories like office supply stores. Suppose you are working towards a milestone like the $30,000 companion certificate. Consider putting spending on that card in its bonus categories, even if you can do slightly better elsewhere. The more miles you earn along the way, the better redemptions you can make. If you decide to go that route, ensure you can achieve that milestone or you’ll leave significant value on the table. Co-branded perks Barclays' business card offerings carry unique perks and milestones to their specific brand. These can incentivize spending and provide potential outsized value, although some perks have high spending requirements to utilize. AAdvantage perks The AAdvantage card offers a 5 percent AAdvantage mileage bonus every year after your account anniversary (terms apply) based on the amount of spending you put on the card. Other card benefits include preferred boarding and your first checked bag free (for you and up to four companions on domestic American itineraries), an annual companion certificate for one guest (worth $99) when you spend $30,000 or more each year and your account remains open 45 days past the anniversary date and 25 percent in-flight savings on food and beverages. These perks benefit frequent travelers, and the spending can also give great value in the right scenario. If you spent $30,000 all within any 2X category, you’d earn the companion certificate, 60,000 miles from spending, plus a 1,500-mile bonus at the end of the year. Considering award flights start as low as 7,500 miles, that’s an excellent return. You can also earn 1X loyalty point for every eligible mile from purchases, meaning you can spend your way to elite status. However, these benchmarks are very high. It takes $40,000 in spending to earn AAdvantage Gold status and a whopping $200,000 to earn AAdvantage Executive Platinum status. While this feature can help qualify for status, we don’t recommend relying solely on spending to achieve status with this card. JetBlue perks The JetBlue card offers Group A boarding and a free first checked bag for you and up to three companions on JetBlue-operated flights, 5,000 bonus points each year after your account anniversary, 50 percent savings on in-flight purchases, 10 percent discount on award redemptions on JetBlue-operated flights and an annual $100 statement credit each year after purchasing a JetBlue Vacations package. The common theme with Barclays airline-branded business cards is the benefits for frequent travelers, which this card provides. The anniversary bonus points and statement credit for JetBlue Vacations also go a long way toward offsetting the annual fee. You can also earn points towards Mosaic status through spending. This is only a wise move if spending on JetBlue purchases. For basic Mosaic status, you’d need either $5,000 in JetBlue spending or $50,000 in credit card spending. For top-tier Mosaic status, that would cost $25,000 in JetBlue spending or a massive $250,000 in credit card spending. Earning points towards status through spending is best suited as a supplement, not the primary method. HawaiianMiles perks The perks on the HawaiianMiles card don’t provide the immediate value of the other cards, but the potential is there if you spend enough. You can earn 20,000 miles if you spend $50,000 to $99,999 in annual purchases or 40,000 miles if you spend $100,000 or more in annual purchases. The spending requirement is very high and the bonus categories outside Hawaiian Airlines purchases are mediocre compared to other cards. It’s not a good value to spend significantly just to earn these miles, although they provide a nice boost if your business reaches these marks organically. This card also includes a one-time 50 percent companion discount for a roundtrip coach flight between Hawaii and North America on Hawaiian Airlines. This discount is limited compared to the AAdvantage certificate. You only get it once, and you still have to book a roundtrip and pay half the cost for your companion, meaning a more expensive flight reduces its value. Wyndham Rewards perks The Wyndham card pays for itself with its additional offerings. You’ll get 15,000 bonus points each anniversary year (worth around $135) which will more than offset the annual fee. With rates starting as low as 7,500 points per night, this can be enough for two free nights and offers more flexibility than a card that just gives you an annual free night certificate. You’ll also get more value from automatic Diamond status, which provides welcome amenities at check-in and can lead to suite upgrades. Other cards with top-tier status have much higher annual fees. Cardmembers also get a booking discount on cash and award bookings, with goFree awards costing 10 percent less. This card provides the most straightforward value to maximize of all Barclays' business cards. Frequently asked questions Does Barclays offer instant approval for its business credit cards?

""" Key Takeaways Your car can be impounded for a variety of reasons, including driving an unregistered or uninsured vehicle. If your car is impounded due to lack of insurance, you will need to obtain insurance and pay all related fees to get it out of the impound lot. In most situations, only the registered owner of the car has the authority to get the car our of the impound lot. Having your car impounded and trying to retrieve it can be a difficult scenario for any motorist. No matter the reason for your vehicle being impounded, it's crucial to grasp that there are specific steps you must adhere to, notably paying the towing and impound charges, in order to get your car back. You'll usually need to provide proof of insurance to reclaim your car from impound, but what if you don't have car insurance? That's when things might become particularly challenging. So, let's explore how you can successfully secure your vehicle from an impound yard, even when you're not insured. What happens when your car is impounded? When your car is impounded, it essentially means that your vehicle has been seized and taken to an impound lot by a police department or a government agency. This action is generally taken without prior notice, and law enforcement officials are not obligated to have a discussion with you about it. The length of time your car can be impounded varies widely based on the laws in your state. It could be as short as 48 hours or as long as an entire year. In some states, like California , there are laws that allow a 30-day hold on an impounded vehicle for certain situations. When a vehicle is impounded, per day storage fees apply to every day the car is there. If you find out that your car has been impounded, try to get it out right away to avoid additional storage fees and the possibility of losing ownership of the vehicle. Many states have a time limit on how long a car can stay in the impound lot before the towing company is allowed sell or scrap the car for parts. Does getting your car impounded affect your insurance? The act of having your car impounded does not directly affect your car insurance rates . However, if your car was impounded because of a lack of insurance, being unregistered or because of moving violations, this could potentially lead to higher premiums. Driving without insurance is considered “risky behavior” and is a rating factor insurance companies underwrite for. If you are stopped due to speeding or a DUI, driving without insurance is usually an additional offense that causes more state fees and an additional surcharge to your car insurance. Maintaining an active insurance policy is a simple way to avoid these extra expenses. Reasons why your car might be impounded There are several reasons why your car might be impounded. Here are a few common scenarios: Driving without a valid driver’s license : If you're caught driving without a valid license, your car can be impounded. Driving without active car insurance : Driving without insurance is a serious violation and can lead to your car being impounded in most states. Unpaid parking tickets : Accumulation of unpaid parking tickets can lead to your car being towed and impounded. Illegal parking : If you park your car illegally, it can be towed and impounded. Unregistered car : In most states, your vehicle needs to be registered before it can be driven or parked on a public road. Note that having an expired registration is different and typically warrants a ticket, not impound. Driving under the influence: Drivers who get pulled over for a DUI/DWI will usually get their car impounded whether they have active insurance or not. Getting your car out of impound after a DUI/DWI can be especially difficult because you may lose your driving privileges. Can the police tow your car for not having insurance? Yes, the police can tow your car for not having insurance in many states. If you are caught driving an uninsured vehicle, you may receive a citation to appear in court with proof of insurance and only need to pay a fine. However, every state and situation is different. In many states, the police have access to license plate readers and can determine if you are driving uninsured before they even pull you over. While being stopped for speeding or reckless driving may increase the chance of having your uninsured vehicle impounded, it is common for a car to be impounded at an insurance check. Can I get my car out of impound without car insurance? The process of getting your car back from the impound lot can be challenging even when you do have insurance. First, you'll need to reach out to the impound lot to clarify if your car has to stay there for a specific time and what the release prerequisites are. Then, you'll need to compile your ID and ownership proof documents like the car title and registration. Finally, you'll need to secure funds to cover all the impound fees, towing costs and any other related expenses and bring them to the impound lot along with your proof of insurance. If you don't have an active policy, you will need to secure one before your vehicle will be released in most states. Can I get car insurance while my car is impounded? Yes, it's possible to take out insurance on a car that's currently impounded. If your car is stuck in an impound lot without insurance, you may need to secure coverage before being permitted to retrieve it. Many insurance companies conveniently offer the option to search for and buy a policy online within minutes, which could be immensely beneficial if you're pressed to show proof of insurance to the impound lot urgently. How to get insurance for an impounded car In order to get your vehicle back, you must show current car insurance proof. This is a rule for all vehicles registered in the U.S. (except New Hampshire) that are being used on public roads. Let's break down what this process may look like: Contact your prior carrier and ask if they are able to reinstate your auto policy without a lapse. In situation where a policy canceled for nonpayment and it has only been a day or two, there is a chance they will continue the policy without a lapse which would allow you to potentially have your ticket and impound fees waived. If you can not have your policy reinstated, ask if you can have your policy started immediately so you can pick your car up that day. Not call carriers offer same day coverage or have a 24/7 sales department. You may need to switch car insurance companies if you are dealing with this situation after hours. If you are not able to secure coverage with your prior carrier, check online for an a company that offers same-day coverage and can either email or fax an ID card to you right away. Keep in mind that you will need to have enough funds available to pay for your car insurance policy and the fees associated with the impound to get your car back. Frequently asked questions [accordions] If my car was repossessed, what should I do with my car insurance? If your car is repossessed, it's important to notify your insurance company. Depending on your situation, you may need to cancel your car insurance or remove the repossessed car from the policy. It is important to keep in mind that some states require for you to surrender your license plates before you can cancel the insurance. If the plates are with the vehicle, you may need to contact the bank to get them back or submit a lost or stolen plate form to your DMV before you can cancel or remove the car from your policy. Will my car insurance cover damage from my car being towed? Whether your insurance covers damage from towing depends on your policy. Theft, vandalism and weather damage can be covered by comprehensive coverage if you have it on your policy. If your vehicle experiences collision damage due to the fault of the towing company, your insurance company may cover the loss but will likely subrogate the claim to recover money from the towing company's insurer. However, if your policy is for liability-only , you will need to work directly with the towing company's insurer to receive payments for the damage. How much does car insurance cost? The cost of car insurance varies depending on a number of factors , including your location, your driving history and the type of car you drive. The average annual cost of car insurance in the U.S. is $2,314 for full coverage and $644 for minimum coverage, but your rate could be higher or lower. Can someone else get my car out of impound? In most situations, only the vehicle's registered owner can get the car out of impound. They must show the impound lot proof of insurance, proof of ownership and an acceptable photo ID. It can be a tricky situation for teen drivers or students away in college who are drivers on the insurance policy but not the owners of the vehicle. In this case, the parent usually needs to be present for the car to be released. Exceptions can be made when the owner is too sick or if the owner is deceased . How much insurance do I need to get my car out of impound? Your car insurance policy must meet the minimum coverage requirement of your state for your car to be let out of impound. This level of coverage varies per state but typically includes bodily injury and property damage. Depending on your state, you may also need uninsured and underinsured motorist liability (UM/UIM) coverage and personal injury protection (PIP). If you start your policy with just the basic coverage required, you may want to revisit your policy and consider increasing your limits for better financial protection. """,gpt-4,ai
""" An umbrella policy is not just a luxury for the wealthy, it is an offensive financial move for anyone looking to protect their assets, savings and future earnings from the uncertainties of life. While your auto, home or renters policy has liability coverage, some personal liability situations can fall outside of basic policy coverage. Bankrate's editorial team, which includes licensed agents with real-world experience, understands that whether you are just starting your career, building your family or have your sights on retirement, all these financial phases in your life need protection. What is an umbrella insurance policy? An umbrella insurance policy is a form of personal liability insurance that goes above and beyond the standard coverage provided by your underlying policies — including your home insurance policy , renters insurance , auto insurance and other policies like watercraft or motorcycle policies . It provides an additional safety net for individuals who might find themselves facing substantial liability claims. If you have to file a liability claim and the loss goes over the limit of that underlying policy, your umbrella could kick in to provide extra financial protection. This may include additional coverage for legal costs after a covered claim. Think of it as a security blanket that wraps around your existing policies, filling in gaps and providing extra protection where needed. How does umbrella insurance work? Umbrella insurance acts as an additional layer of protection that covers you and those living in your household. It can help cover legal matters if you’re found responsible for causing damage to someone else’s property or if someone gets hurt on your property. You'll rarely file a claim for a new incident directly on your umbrella policy, except in certain cases where coverage isn't available from your underlying policy but is covered under an umbrella polic y. If something happens — whether it's on your auto , home or any other insurance policy — you'll usually file the claim on the corresponding policy first. When the umbrella policy acts as the primary policy, policyholders may be responsible for a self-insured retention (SIR) fee. Policyholders must pay this fee for the umbrella policy to become operational. Some examples of when your umbrella insurance typically will not have underlying coverage are: Claims of liable and slander False arrest, imprisonment or detention Invasion of privacy Malicious prosecution Wrongful eviction or entry What is the difference between umbrella insurance and excess liability insurance? While both umbrella insurance and excess liability insurance aim to provide additional coverage over your base policies, they do so in different ways. Excess insurance simply extends the financial limits of your existing policy without changing its terms or coverage. It provides extra protection for the same potential risks and only comes into play when your main policy's limits have been exhausted, often in cases of significant claims. Umbrella insurance, on the other hand, does broaden the scope of coverage. It can cover situations not covered by your base policies. It has the ability to extend protection across multiple primary policies and can potentially offer higher liability limits. Unlike excess insurance, umbrella insurance may have its own unique restrictions and exclusions. What does an umbrella policy cover? An umbrella policy may provide peace of mind when you face costly liability claims, but it may be important to understand what it does and does not cover. Most umbrella policies will cover: Bodily injury: Umbrella policies may provide excess liability coverage for injuries that you cause to others, whether those injuries occur in an at-fault auto accident, at your home or off your premises. If you are found liable for injuries , your umbrella may help pay the costs. Landlord liability: Some umbrella policies provide a certain level of coverage for landlords. For instance, if you own a home you rent out, you could be found liable for injuries that occur at that location. Perhaps the concrete sidewalk to the front door is heaved and a guest of the tenant trips and breaks an arm. Your umbrella policy might help cover the damages after your landlord policy reaches its limit. Property damage: Umbrella coverage may apply to property damage that you cause to others. Like liability claims, coverage would also only apply if the damage exceeds your underlying policy limits. Personal injury: Personal injury coverage covers legal expenses when someone sues you for libel, slander or wrongful eviction. The liability coverage in homeowners policies often excludes personal injury coverage, although an endorsement can sometimes add it. This is a scenario where your umbrella coverage might kick in without a claim being filed on an underlying policy. In general, umbrella policies cover liability claims that go above and beyond the limits of your underlying policies. In rare circumstances, an umbrella policy may offer coverage for instances not covered by your underlying policies. Examples of situations covered by umbrella insurance You injure someone in a car accident: Imagine that you cause a car accident that results in serious injuries to the other party. If you have $100,000 in bodily injury liability per person on your auto policy but their total injuries amount to $175,000, your umbrella policy could step in to help pay the overage of $75,000, so you don’t have to pay out of pocket. Someone drowns in your pool: If someone is injured or drowns in your swimming pool , the financial costs may be extreme. Most home insurance policies include $100,000 to $300,000 in personal liability coverage , but an umbrella could provide extra coverage in scenarios like pool injuries. You damage a rented home: Suppose you rent a home for a vacation and don’t properly extinguish the campfire you enjoyed on the deck. If your actions start a fire that damages the home, your home insurance policy and your umbrella policy could help pay for the damage. Your dog bites someone: If you are talking with your neighbor in the front yard and your dog bites their hand, umbrella insurance could help you cover expenses related to the injury. Some breeds may be excluded from umbrella policies, so check the terms and conditions of your policy. Someone trips on your porch: Imagine a delivery person or party guest trips over a crack in your cement porch. If the claim exceeds the liability covered by your standard homeowners, your umbrella policy can likely kick in. You’re involved in certain lawsuits: While your umbrella coverage won’t cover you against all legal allegations, it can kick in during select situations. For instance, your umbrella insurance may be able to cover you if you’re sued for damages related to slander, libel or mental anguish. You're teen is accused of slander on social media: If your teen post a negative comment about a classmate on social media it could cause reputational harm. If their parents sue for defamation of character, your policy extends to household family members and the claim may be covered. What does an umbrella insurance policy exclude? Umbrellas may be helpful policies, but they don’t cover everything. Here are some things that typically aren’t covered by personal umbrella insurance: Property damage that you sustain: The only kind of property damage that umbrellas may cover is damage you cause to the property of others. Your own property is never covered by umbrella policies. Umbrellas provide extra liability coverage, not extra personal property coverage. Personal belongings: The personal property coverage of your homeowners policy will pay to replace your belongings like clothing and furniture following a covered loss, but an umbrella policy won’t. Umbrella insurance only covers the personal belongings of others when you’re at fault for a loss. Business-related losses: A personal umbrella policy will not typically cover any losses related to a business unless the business is covered under your home insurance policy. Likewise, umbrella insurance will not cover court costs or attorney fees associated with lawsuits filed against your business unless the business is covered by your home insurance. Some home insurance policies may cover certain small business operations, but you’ll likely need to buy business insurance, including a business umbrella insurance policy, to get the coverage you need. Losses caused by criminal acts: Similar to the liability coverage of home and auto policies, an umbrella policy does not cover losses caused by a policyholder’s illegal or intentional activity. For instance, if a policyholder operates an illegal, homemade fireworks business and an accidental explosion burns down a neighbor’s home, or if a policyholder deliberately damages the neighbor’s property, the insurer would likely deny the claim. Oral or written contracts: If a contractor sues you for not honoring oral or written contract terms, your umbrella policy likely won’t cover your legal expenses. Keep in mind that all policies are different. To make sure you understand what your umbrella insurance does and doesn’t cover, you might want to talk to your insurance agent or company. How much does umbrella insurance cost? How much an umbrella policy costs depends on many variables. Many of the factors that affect your home insurance and auto insurance costs may affect the cost of your umbrella policy. These could include location, the features in your home, the types of cars you drive and your claims history. The underwriting criteria for an umbrella policy can be more restrictive than an auto or home policy. Those with occupations deemed too risky or who have had liability claims in the past may not qualify for coverage. The cost of umbrella insurance will also vary based on how much coverage you purchase. Most umbrella policies start at $1 million, but for an additional premium $3 and $5 million policy limits are standard options. Additionally, the number of underlying policies that an umbrella covers may also affect costs. A $1 million umbrella that is providing extra coverage for a home and auto policy will likely cost less than a $1 million umbrella that covers a home policy, an auto policy, a vacation home policy and a boat policy, for example. This is because the company issuing the umbrella policy likely sees additional underlying policies as riskier. On average, $1 million in umbrella coverage costs between $200 and $300 a year. Where can I purchase an umbrella policy? You can purchase an umbrella policy as a standalone policy or bundle your policy with your existing auto, home or renters carrier if they offer it. Regardless of where you buy your umbrella policy, the insurer will likely have certain requirements for your underlying coverage. The most common requirement is for your auto policy to have liability limits of 250/500/100 and for your home insurance to have a personal liability limit of $300,000. Not having an active auto insurance policy can be a significant roadblock when looking for an umbrella policy. If you do not own a vehicle and want an umbrella policy, inquire about non-owner insurance . This type of policy usually can meet the requirement of an underlying auto policy without the additional expense of comprehensive or collision coverage . It has the added benefit of extending liability coverage to a vehicle you may rent or borrow. Some auto and homeowners insurance companies may enable you to increase your liability limits to $1 million which may eliminate the need for an umbrella insurance policy. However, keep in mind that increasing your liability limits on your auto and home policy doesn’t change the liability limits on your other policies. Nor does it provide addition coverage for liability losses those policies won't cover. Who needs umbrella insurance? Generally, you might want to consider an umbrella policy if you have any personal factors that pose greater liability risks or if you have high-value assets. These could include: Owning amenities or attractive nuisances, such as hot tubs, swimming pools, trampolines and treehouses. Having rental properties. Having extensive savings that you need to protect. Having an earning potential that predictably creates future wealth. Having a lifestyle or job that indicates wealth even if it isn’t there, such as driving a high-end car, being a doctor or owning a business. Frequently entertaining guests, especially if alcohol is served in your home. Having children or often having children in your care. Umbrella coverage provides an extra layer of financial protection against liability claims. Even if you don’t have high-value assets or elements that post a higher level of risk, it might be worth looking into umbrella coverage. If you’re not sure if an umbrella policy is right for your needs, consider talking with a licensed insurance agent or financial advisor. Frequently asked questions Does having children increase my liability risk? Having or frequently caring for children may be a commonly overlooked factor in the umbrella coverage decision-making process. Whether you have one child or many, the inherent liability risk that comes with children of any age means that parents, guardians and caregivers may want to consider an umbrella policy. Parents and guardians of children are usually legally and financially responsible for the child’s actions through vicarious liability. Here are a few examples of when an umbrella policy may help: Your young child pushes another child off the slide at the park, causing severe injuries. Your older child posts slanderous comments on a social media platform, causing another child mental anguish or embarrassment. Your teen throws a house party and serves alcohol while you are out of town. A partygoer is injured or killed on the way home due to underage drinking and driving. Should I purchase umbrella coverage if my home has a swimming pool? Home features like swimming pools, fire pits, hot tubs and treehouses may increase your liability risk. If a guest sustains an injury on your property, there is a chance that your standard homeowners insurance policy won’t have adequate liability coverage to protect you if you’re found negligent. Umbrella insurance may help cover medical expenses and legal costs that exceed your primary policy’s limits. How much umbrella insurance do I need? There isn’t a way to plan for every possible scenario and the appropriate level of umbrella insurance will be different for everyone — no one wants to be over or under-insured. Typically, the goal is to have liability coverage equal to the total sum of your assets. Work with your insurance agent and financial advisor to find the proper coverage limit. Are liability coverage and an umbrella insurance policy the same? Liability coverage and an umbrella insurance policy both offer liability protection. However, an umbrella is its own policy, while liability coverage is a component of an underlying policy. The umbrella insurance policy typically only gets used if you exhaust the underlying liability coverage on your home, auto or other applicable policy. However, an umbrella policy may be used in instances that are not covered by the underlying policy, such as personal injury. The umbrella insurance policy acts as a second layer of liability protection to back up your other insurance policies. Can I get umbrella insurance for my business? Yes, you can get business umbrella insurance. You’ll likely have to purchase other forms of business insurance as well because business umbrellas work just like personal umbrellas — the coverage only kicks in after the liability limit on the underlying policy is exhausted. Many of the best home and car insurance companies also offer business insurance, which might make it easier to get a quote and manage your policies. """,gpt-4,ai
""" Investing can be a complex world, with many different players, strategies and goals. Two of the most significant types of investors are individual investors and institutional investors. Individual investors are individuals investing on their own behalf, and are also called retail investors. Institutional investors are large firms that invest money on behalf of others, and the group includes large organizations with professional analysts. These two groups approach investing in very different ways, and understanding these differences can be helpful for anyone trying to navigate the market. Here's what you need to know. What is an institutional investor? An institutional investor is a large organization that invests money on behalf of others. These investors come in many forms, such as pensions, mutual funds, banks, hedge funds, insurance companies and more. For example, one type of institutional investor is a mutual fund, in which a fund manager buys and sells securities on behalf of the individual investors who buy the fund. Institutional investors pool money for individual investors or organizations. Because they pool money, institutional investors have much more money to invest than all but the wealthiest individual investors. They use that money to buy large blocks of securities, and their massive size means that institutional investors’ trades can have a powerful impact on the market. Institutional investors tend to have more experience in the market and more knowledge. They may have access to investment research that retail investors do not and have financial resources that allow them to conduct their own research. In addition, they might have access to investments individuals do not, such as institutional index funds with very high minimums. These large institutional funds often have lower fees than those available to individual investors. Because institutional investors tend to be more knowledgeable and experienced, they must comply with different Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations then individual investors. What is an individual (retail) investor? An individual investor, or retail investor, is a person who invests their own money, usually through an online broker, bank or a mutual fund. They invest to meet their individual investment goals, such as to save for retirement, a child’s education fund or to build wealth generally. Individual investors usually invest smaller amounts more frequently than institutional investors. For example, they may have money withheld from each paycheck for an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan . Or they might automatically invest money in an IRA every month. Retail investors tend to be less experienced and less knowledgeable than institutional investors. This, in addition to the fact that retail investors trade with their own money, might explain why they are more prone to emotional trading decisions than institutional investors. Key differences between individual and institutional investors We’ve highlighted some of the differences between these two types of investors throughout, but now let’s compare them side-by-side. Investment volume and access Individual investors tend to invest small amounts of money, such as with each paycheck. They often invest through mutual funds at work or buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from an online broker. Institutional investors, on the other hand, tend to buy or sell in bulk, because they usually have much more money to trade than retail investors. This amount of money gives them access to institutional funds with minimums that put them out of reach for most individual investors. But having a huge amount of money does come with some downsides, too. Large investors are unable to invest in the market’s smaller stocks, because it just won’t “move the needle” on their performance. In contrast, individual investors can buy many smaller, still-attractive stocks without fear that all the good bargains will be purchased by institutional investors. Knowledge and research Institutional investors tend to have a significant advantage over individual investors in investment knowledge and research. Institutional investors have more resources, allowing them to conduct more detailed research and therefore make more informed investment decisions. The information gap has narrowed somewhat in recent years since many of the best online brokers for stock trading now offer extensive research tools to everyday invesotes. However, institutional investors still tend to be better informed than individual investors. Fees Institutional investors have also had the advantage when it comes to fees. Institutional funds, for instance, tend to have high minimum investments but also come with lower fees. Fortunately, this gap has also narrowed in recent years after a majority of online brokers eliminated trading fees and some of the best index funds have cut their expense ratios to near zero. Temperament While many individual investors are impulsive or think only about the short term, the best individuals have a clear edge over institutional investors because of a superior temperament. For example, when the market falls, many institutional investors such as mutual funds have to sell to meet redemptions in their funds, as their investors run for the exits. In contrast, even-tempered individual investors don’t face this imperative, and can more thoughtfully evaluate the market, find attractive investments amid the rubble and continue to think long term. Additionally, institutional investors may have a decision-making process that involves several people or investment committees, which can slow down decisions and lead to a herd mentality. Individuals only have to answer to themselves, which may be an advantage during periods of volatility when the investment landscape is changing quickly. Bottom line Individual investors and institutional investors are the two major groups that invest in the market. Both types of investors have their own advantages, and a sharp investor will try to make the best use of their own advantages, whether that’s size, agility or knowledge, to outperform. """,gpt-4,ai
""" Drivers in the U.S. reported over a million motor vehicles stolen in 2023, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). That's roughly the same theft rate as 2022, but part of an ongoing spike in auto theft since 2019. The latest auto theft statistics available from NICB, the FBI and other expert sources indicate that technological vulnerabilities are a major driver of motor vehicle theft in 2024. Key auto theft statistics Bankrate insights [box] 1,020,729 vehicles were reported stolen in 2023, up from 1,008,756 in 2022. ( NICB ) California remains the state with the highest number of vehicles stolen in 2023 (208,668), but Maryland and the District of Columbia saw the biggest percent increase in thefts from 2022 to 2023. (NICB) Theft claim frequency for 2003–2023 Hyundai and Kia models was almost 7 times higher than for all other makes in the first six months of 2023. ( IIHS-HLDI ) The average claim severity for stolen cars other than Hyundai and Kia models was $21,681 in the first half of 2023. (IIHS-HLDI) Motor vehicle theft is the third most common property crime in the United States. ( U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics ) In 2022, over 85 percent of stolen vehicles were recovered, with 34 percent recovered the same day. ( NICB ) How often do cars get stolen? Car theft is increasingly common in the U.S. In 2023, 1,020,729 vehicles were stolen, compared to 1,008,756 in 2022 and 794,019 in 2019, according to the NICB . That's an increase of 28.5 percent in just four years. According to the latest data from the FBI , the motor vehicle theft rate per 100k people in the U.S. was 282.7 in 2022. The FBI also found that: 45 percent of auto theft victims in 2022 were between the ages of 20 and 39. 12 percent of offenders in 2022 were teenagers. Only 23 percent of auto thefts were committed by offenders confirmed to be known to the victim. 33 percent of stolen vehicles were taken from a residence, compared to 25 percent from a highway or street and 23 percent from a parking lot or garage. In other words, while rates of car theft are up across the country, you're more likely to experience this crime if you're a young driver parking your car somewhere other than a home garage. Where do the most cars get stolen? In 2023, the three states with the highest motor vehicle theft rates per 100k people were the District of Columbia, Colorado and Nevada. The top metropolitan statistical areas by theft volume were Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley and Chicago-Naperville-Elgin. The five states with the greatest increase in auto theft rate from 2022 were District of Columbia (64 percent), Maryland (63 percent), Connecticut (33 percent), Nevada (18 percent) and Massachusetts (16 percent). The Washington-Arlington-Alexandria metro area saw the largest increase in thefts compared to 2022 (52 percent). The Denver-Aurora-Lakewood area saw the largest decrease in auto thefts from 2022 to 2023 (-22 percent). San Francisco, Philadelphia and Dallas-Fort Worth saw major spikes in auto thefts (28, 19 and 13 percent). California, Texas and Florida remain the three states with the highest overall number of cars stolen in 2023 due to high population numbers, but none of these saw a major increase in theft rates from 2022 to 2023. Car theft statistics by state The NICB hasn't yet released its full auto theft report for 2023, but 2022 data points to states in the West and the Washington, D.C., area as key areas for motor vehicle theft, while New England states like Maine and New Hampshire see the lowest rates of auto theft overall. State 2022 Theft rate per 100k people 2022 Thefts Colorado 731.28 42,706 District of Columbia 700.06 4,703 Washington 603.54 46,990 Oregon 540.88 22,934 New Mexico 540.57 11,424 California 520.17 203,018 Missouri 482.60 29,815 Nevada 480.81 15,279 Texas 350.10 105,133 Tennessee 337.95 23,830 Minnesota 311.90 17,832 Illinois 307.57 38,699 Oklahoma 298.70 12,007 Louisiana 297.11 13,638 Arizona 294.79 21,694 Kansas 292.39 8,588 South Carolina 290.48 15,345 Arkansas 269.76 8,216 Maryland 260.94 16,086 Ohio 258.26 30,361 Nebraska 257.02 5,058 Michigan 256.65 25,753 South Dakota 248.29 2,259 Alaska 245.64 1,802 Georgia 243.86 26,612 Kentucky 226.43 10,217 Indiana 225.96 15,440 North Dakota 224.57 1,750 Montana 223.71 2,512 North Carolina 220.36 23,576 Utah 209.48 7,082 Alabama 209.21 10,616 Mississippi 209.18 6,150 Florida 206.88 46,020 Wisconsin 198.71 11,709 Connecticut 195.55 7,091 Delaware 184.51 1,879 Hawaii 183.24 2,639 New Jersey 174.54 16,165 Pennsylvania 172.73 22,407 Iowa 168.07 5,379 Rhode Island 164.21 1,796 Virginia 164.17 14,256 Vermont 160.57 1,039 New York 143.94 28,323 Wyoming 132.44 770 West Virginia 115.26 2,046 Massachusetts 101.46 7,084 Idaho 91.08 1,766 Puerto Rico 84.89 2,735 Maine 68.14 944 New Hampshire 53.75 750 What vehicles are stolen most often? Data from the NICB and HLDI show that full-size pickup trucks, older Honda sedans and Hyundai and Kia vehicles from 2011 to 2022 are the most-stolen vehicles in the U.S. today. Full-size Chevrolet pickups top the NICB's list of most stolen vehicles for 2022 with 49,903 total thefts that year. Two more large pickups — the Ford F-150 and GMC Sierra — also made the top 10. The other vehicles on the list were primarily sedans. Vehicle Total thefts in 2022 Most-stolen model year Full-size Chevrolet pickup (e.g. Silverado) 49,903 2004 Full-size Ford pickup (e.g. F-150) 48,175 2006 Honda Civic 27,113 2000 Honda Accord 27,089 1997 Hyundai Sonata 21,707 2013 Hyundai Elantra 19,602 2017 Kia Optima 18,221 2015 Toyota Camry 17,094 2021 Full-size GMC pickup (e.g. Sierra 1500) 16,622 2005 Honda CR-V 13,832 2001 Used cars are also more likely to be stolen than new cars, according to NICB's research. With the exception of the Toyota Camry, the most-stolen model year for the top 10 models was at least five model years old. Hyundai and Kia thefts account for huge 2023 increases Stealing Hyundai and Kia vehicles was more than a crime trend in 2023. It was also a social media trend, driven by a notable crack in the makes' technological armor. While most cars manufactured in the 2010s included immobilizers — passive security systems that require a programmed key fob to match the car's security system before the vehicle can be turned on — Hyundai and Kia didn't include these devices in many of their cars manufactured between 2011 and 2022. Only 26 percent of Hyundai and Kia vehicles from the 2015 model year came with immobilizers, compared to 96 percent of cars from other manufacturers. TikTok users discovered this technological security oversight and sparked an explosive auto theft fad, leading theft claims for Kia and Hyundai users to increase dramatically in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, insurance claim frequency for Hyundai and Kia users was 364 percent higher than the claim frequency for all others makes; in the first six months of 2023, it jumped to 681 percent. Model years from 2011 to 2021 saw the most severe increases. Colorado and Wisconsin were among the first states to see a spike in Hyundai and Kia thefts, according to HLDI . In 2023, Maryland's rising auto theft rates were driven in large part by Hyundai and Kia thefts, leading the city of Baltimore to file a lawsuit against both automakers in May 2023. Does car insurance cover theft? Your car insurance handles theft and loss in a few different ways. The comprehensive portion of your insurance policy typically covers the theft of your vehicle . It also can cover the cost of repairs, such as broken windows, locks or ignition. If you don't have comprehensive coverage on your policy, however, you won't be able to file a theft claim with your insurance company. Your comprehensive coverage only covers the vehicle itself, not the items inside, so your personal belongings are not typically covered by your car insurance. However, if you have homeowners insurance or renters insurance , the personal belongings in your vehicle would likely be covered through that policy. This means that when it comes time to report your losses, you would likely need to file both a car insurance claim and a home insurance claim. Vehicle theft rates are one of many rating factors considered by car insurance companies. If you have a model that is often stolen or susceptible to theft, you'll likely pay higher coverage rates as a result. For example, some insurers will not issue policies to Kia or Hyundai drivers with a model from 2011 to 2021 due to the high theft rates for these cars. How to prevent car theft Car theft methods are increasingly technologically advanced, as thieves learn how to exploit modern vehicle security systems. Keyless entry hacks, reprogrammed vehicle software and key codes linked to VINs all allow easy entry for thieves, making car security a moving target. To maximize your vehicle's security (and potentially earn an extra insurance discount ), consider the following measures: Smart parking: A locked home garage is one of the greatest theft deterrents, but locking your car when you're not in it, parking in well-lit areas and keeping your key fob with you can help prevent theft. Keep your seats clear: Visible valuables inside your car can attract thieves — and so can blankets, coats or other items that look as if they're covering valuables. Invest in locks: Purchase locks for your steering wheel, your hood and/or your wheels to secure your car when it's not in use. Add a GPS tracker: Tracking your car won't prevent theft, but it could increase the chances of recovering a stolen vehicle quickly. """,gpt-4,ai
""" The insurance industry is increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to improve operational performance in areas like claims processing, underwriting, marketing and fraud detection. AI can enhance the speed and accuracy of these processes, but it also introduces potential issues like machine-generated errors, lack of transparency and bias. As AI becomes more integrated into the insurance sector, it's crucial for companies to maintain transparency and for consumers to increase their understanding of AI. How is artificial intelligence being used in the insurance industry? Insurers across the auto, home and life industries are adopting AI to enhance operational performance in areas like claims processing, underwriting, marketing and fraud detection. In surveys conducted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in 2022 and 2023, 88 percent of auto insurance companies reported that they use or plan to explore the use of AI in their business, compared to 70 percent of home insurers and 58 percent of life insurance companies . Key findings of the NAIC Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Surveys [insights box] The majority of auto, home and life insurance companies in the U.S. are currently using AI in at least one business application. 47 percent of home insurance companies and 18 percent of auto insurance companies reported using AI tools in underwriting. Underwriting and marketing are the most common AI use cases in life insurance. The three biggest areas of AI research in the auto and home insurance industries are underwriting, rating and fraud prevention. How are those companies actually deploying AI in their daily operations? That's a little harder to determine, says Kathleen A. Birrane, Maryland Insurance Commissioner and member of the NAIC's working group on artificial intelligence . “ The insurance industry as a whole has been a slower adopter of AI than other industries,” Birrane says. ""Part of the reason for that is because decision making by insurance companies is so heavily regulated.” Some of AI's more familiar use cases in insurance don't involve regulated areas of insurance that have the potential to impact consumers. Think customer service chatbots, which companies like Progressive and Geico have been using for years. But in recent years, more and more insurers have started experimenting with AI to estimate claim amounts, approve or deny claims and underwrite insurance — all of which involve decisions traditionally made by human intelligence that are tightly regulated by state insurance laws. While that might sound risky, it's important to note that AI doesn't necessarily replace human decision-making in insurance. It might be better to think of AI less as a replacement for human intelligence and more as a powerful computing tool that can support human workers in making key insurance decisions — and making them more quickly. AI's fundamental advantage in the insurance industry is its ability to work with huge datasets that would be unmanageable for humans. Doing so allows carriers to speed up routine processes, increase accuracy and even offer innovation by freeing up human intelligence for higher-level tasks. Accelerated underwriting: An example from the life insurance industry Let's look at the life insurance industry as an example: in traditional life insurance underwriting , applicants often have to provide a host of medical records in order to be approved for a policy. “You're getting on the scale,” Birrane says; “you might be getting a blood test .” All of that takes time, both for you and for the insurance company — but when life insurance companies employ AI in underwriting, this process can be expedited. “What they're trying to do is substitute all of the physical work,"" says Birrane. ""They're trying to close it fast and make it easy for a generation that doesn't want to fill out 800 forms or go in and meet with somebody and give bodily fluid samples. They just want to close the deal online.” No scale, no needle in your arm — just a profile generated by an AI program that can compare your data to a vast bank of other policyholders' data and get you a price and a policy in record time. What is AI? [insights box] Artificial intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, is the imitation of human cognitive processes through machines, particularly computer systems. AI includes a range of technologies such as expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), voice identification and machine vision. It's a procedure that requires processing vast volumes of labeled training data, identifying correlations and trends and leveraging these trends for future predictions. While generative AI, like ChatGPT, is dominating recent conversations, other forms of AI are already part of our daily life. Virtual assistants, like Siri and Alexa, for instance, employ AI to answer your questions, set calendar reminders and turn on your music. When you talk to a customer service chatbot or type a question into Google, you're interacting with AI in real time. But AI is increasingly at work behind the scenes in industries like insurance to optimize routine processes and improve overall efficiency. How will AI affect my insurance? It's impossible to say exactly how AI will affect any individual's insurance in the next few years, as insurance companies continue to develop and refine AI tools. Every company's adoption of AI and machine learning (ML) will look different, so the company that oversees your insurance matters as much as general trends in the industry. In general, however, the two trends most likely to affect consumers in the insurance industry are faster claims processing and increased accuracy in insurance pricing — both of which could come with pros and cons depending on your situation. Faster claims processing times AI has the potential to significantly reduce the time it takes an insurer to process a customer's claim. According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group , your insurance company might use AI tools to analyze your notice of loss for missing information, summarize key information for adjusters, identify a successful negotiation strategy based on previous cases, draft communications from your agent and prepare reports. Home and auto insurers in the NAIC's AI/ML surveys reported using AI tools to determine settlement amounts, pull relevant information, triage and assign cases to adjusters and evaluate loss images. In 2022, nine auto insurance companies also reported using AI to approve car insurance claims . All of these tasks, when carried out by human adjusters, add dozens of hours to the time between when you submit a claim to your insurance company and when you receive your decision or the final payout. Slow claim responses have historically been a major pain point for consumers, so the adoption of AI to cut down on wait times could mean an improvement in customer experiences. It could also reduce the cost of handling each claim, which has the potential to translate into overall savings for consumers. Transparency and accuracy are paramount when it comes to processing claims, and AI introduces some new potential speed bumps to the process. Software used to analyze loss images, for insurance, is subject to errors that humans might not make. Birrane gives the example of the use of drone imagery in processing home insurance claims . Drones are increasingly used to capture footage of homes which can then be analyzed by AI tools to approve or deny claims or determine a settlement amount. But the software is vulnerable to mistakes, such as mistaking a shadow on a roof for pre-existing damage which could result in a claim being denied. “People know that drone technology is being utilized generically,” Birrane says. “But do I know that they came and looked at my house?” Without transparency on the part of insurers, customers can be left in the dark and without further recourse regarding a claim denial. “I don't have any problem with using drones,” she says. “What I want to make sure of as a regulator is that that consumer understands that a drone was used, understands what their profile was as a result of that, and has the opportunity to correct misinformation.” More accurate pricing As home and auto insurance rates continue to climb across the U.S., the use of AI in insurance underwriting raises both hopes and fears for consumers. Will AI's advanced data analytics capabilities, which allow insurers to hone in on increasingly detailed individual profiles in underwriting coverage, bring prices down — or drive them up? The answer might be a bit of both. While AI-enhanced underwriting certainly has the potential to make pricing more personalized and thus more accurate, it's up to insurers to choose how they want to deploy those capabilities. Some insurance companies might use AI tools to spread risk out across risk pools, charging low-risk customers slightly more in order to offer affordable rates for high-risk customers, while others might hone in on the best risk profiles and price out less desirable customers. ""It's critically important that consumers shop, shop, shop ,"" Birran concludes, ""because companies have different philosophies."" But with the promise of more accurate pricing comes the risk of discrimination. “Personalization is one of the key features of AI across all industries,” says Cameron Hurta, managing editor for AI products at Bankrate. “But the danger of personalization is bias.” As AI tools recognize patterns in customer data, they could inadvertently privilege certain classes over others if data that's currently understood as neutral serves as a proxy for protected categories like race, ethnicity or religion. And the fact that insurers can't collect this type of protected demographic data will increase the challenge of identifying – and stopping – bias in AI-supported insurance underwriting. Making sure that AI tools don't conflict with existing regulatory standards will be one of the primary focuses for the NAIC in coming years. “The question is, how do you figure out redlining, whether it’s intentional or unintentional, in an AI-driven world? Once upon a time, you could literally draw a red line and say, ‘You’re not writing anywhere there, hmm, what’s different about that area?’ I t’s a lot harder to do that and more subtle when you’re looking at data to see what somebody’s rating platform and their characteristics and what they’re looking at just happen conveniently to exclude.” What is the future of AI in insurance? As insurance companies continue to integrate AI and ML into their business practices, expect to see some of the following trends: Faster claim times: Speeding up claims by automating routine parts of the process with AI could be a key strategy for companies struggling to keep customers in an increasingly pricey market. Mixed transparency: Some insurers will proudly put their AI credentials front and center; others might choose to take a more discreet approach to AI. Experiments in pricing: As AI helps insurers cut closer to accuracy with detailed customer profiles, you might see your quotes from various insurers go up or down – depending on how they've chosen to deploy AI. Personalized coverage: There's a lot of buzz about the potential of AI to offer new types of coverage tailored to the individual needs of each customer, rather than a one-size-fits-all policy. This could look like individualized endorsements, discounts or coverage limits. Conversations around bias: Insurers and regulators are both working to determine what responsible AI use looks like and how to make sure companies follow best practices for governance. One thing's for sure: AI is here to stay in the insurance industry. But so are humans. For each of these new frontiers of AI-driven insurance, AI tools will need human intelligence to program, check and steer their operation. Frequently asked questions [accordions] How is AI changing the insurance industry? As the adoption of AI tools becomes more widespread in the insurance sector, artificial intelligence has the potential to change the insurance industry by speeding up routine tasks, redirecting human expertise towards higher-level work and saving companies money overall by automating processes that don't require human insight and creativity. What are the risks of AI in insurance? Using AI in insurance comes with risks like unintended bias, inaccuracies in interpretation of visual and other data and increased pricing for some consumers. Transparency on the part of insurance companies and increased AI literacy on the part of consumers may help to reduce these risks. How is AI used in insurance pricing? Insurance companies deploy AI and ML in a variety of ways in setting insurance prices. The primary role of AI tools in insurance underwriting is to create more detailed and accurate customer risk profiles based on huge datasets. Depending on how insurers choose to use these profiles, prices could go up or down for various customers based on their unique profile. Which insurance companies are using AI to deny claims? In a survey of 193 auto insurance companies published by the NAIC in December 2022, no companies reported using AI to deny insurance claims. However, nine companies reported using AI to approve claims, while five more companies said they were researching this use case. More companies may have begun to experiment with AI in claim denial since 2022. Will insurance agents be replaced by AI? Some insurance companies have already introduced AI tools in place of roles traditionally served by human agents, such as customer service and marketing. But it's unlikely that direct digital sales and chatbots will entirely drive out human insurance agents , who can help navigate complex insurance situations and answer questions that a chatbot might not grasp the nuances of.

""" How to give a savings bond as a gift Byline: Sheiresa McRae Ngo Portions of this article were drafted using an in-house natural language generation platform . The article was reviewed, fact-checked and edited by our editorial staff . Birthdays, graduations, and other special occasions are usually cele brat ed with a gift. It’s a common way to wish your loved ones well. If you’re looking for gift ideas for family or friends, you might be considering a savings bond . A savings bond is not just a present but an investment in the recipient's future. Bankrate's 2024 emergency savings report revealed just 44 percent of respondents have an adequate rainy day fund, so this is one way to jumpstart savings. Here is everything you need to know about giving a savings bond as a gift. What is a savings bond? A savings bond is a government-backed debt security that can be purchased in your name or as a gift for someone else. They're seen as one of the most secure investment options, thanks to the backing of the U.S. government. “It's a U.S. Treasury-issued loan where you are loaning money to the U.S. government in exchange for interest back,” explains Katie Brewer, CFP and owner of Your Richest Life . Savings bonds accrue interest over time and can be cashed in after a certain period, typically from one to 30 years. The money invested is secure and steadily grows, making it a reliable and low-risk investment. Types of savings bonds The two main types of savings bonds are Series EE and I bonds.

Factors to consider when gifting a savings bond Before purchasing a savings bond as a gift, there are a few things to consider. Bear in mind the recipient's goals and circumstances. “Take into account the receiver's financial goals before deciding on which bond to gift,” says Jonathan Feniak, general counsel and head of finance at LLC Attorney . “Avoid gifting savings bonds if the recipient needs cash right away.” There is a penalty associated with redeeming a bond prematurely. Savings bonds cashed within the first five years of issue result in a loss of the last three months of interest. Next, consider the type of bond that would be most beneficial.

""" Excerpt: Will multiple accidents cost you your car insurance? Bankrate investigates. If you have ever wondered how many claims are allowed in car insurance, Bankrate can help. There's no single answer—every insurance company follows its own regulations. Some carriers may have limits, such as two at-fault accidents in one year, while others may drop your policy after only one. Some insurers categorize those with multiple at-fault accidents as high-risk drivers, and if you fit this category, you may need to search for a company that is willing to carry your policy. Bankrate explores how many accidents before insurance drops you to help you understand your situation after you're in a collision. [auto rates widget] Car insurance with multiple claims Whether you are looking to purchase a new insurance policy or renewing your existing car insurance , insurers often use your claims history to help determine if you qualify for insurance and what your premium will be. Insurance companies also use your age (except in Hawaii and Massachusetts), location and driving record as qualifying factors for coverage. How claims history is used can vary by insurance company. Some may only look back three years, while other companies may go back as far as five years or more. Many carriers consider the frequency of claims over the severity, and some may only use claims that meet a minimum dollar threshold to determine eligibility and rates. While the number of claims you have filed in the last few years matters, so does the type of claim filed . For instance, a claim on an accident you didn’t cause may not be treated as severely as one for an at-fault accident that you did cause. Read more: How is fault determined in a car accident? Can insurance drop you for too many claims? Yes, your car insurance company can drop you if you file too many claims. Most often, an insurer will send a nonrenewal letter prior to your next renewal period, advising that your insurance will be terminated at the end of the policy period. In order to maintain continuous coverage, you should look for insurance with another carrier . You may need to consider nonstandard companies offering multiple accidents car insurance, often called high-risk car insurance . Insurers generally can’t cancel your coverage mid-term, so if you are found to be too high-risk for a particular carrier, you may have some time to search for a new company. How many accidents can you have before your insurance drops you? The threshold for canceling car insurance after multiple accidents differs by insurance carrier, the type of claim, the payout amount and the number of claims you have filed in a three-year period. But having more than one at-fault accident generally gives you a higher chance of being dropped by your insurance company. Read more: What to do if your car Insurance is canceled At-fault versus not-at-fault claims Although the penalties are often more severe for at-fault accidents, both at-fault and not-at-fault insurance claims can increase your premiums. Hitting another vehicle while changing lanes on the highway or rear-ending one at a red light are examples of at-fault accidents . In these cases, your bodily injury liability and property damage liability will likely help cover the other driver’s costs. And if you have collision coverage, that could help cover repairs for your own vehicle. In contrast, if someone changes lanes into your vehicle or rear-ends it when you’re stopped at a red light, it would usually be considered a not-at-fault accident. Whether a claim is determined to be at fault or not at fault typically changes how your car insurance rates are impacted and could affect your coverage qualification. Average annual premiums for drivers with an at-fault accident by carrier The rate you pay for car insurance tends to vary by insurance carrier — and so does the amount you will pay after an at-fault accident. The table below shows the average car insurance increase after an at-fault accident by the insurance companies with the largest market share in the nation. What if I have accident forgiveness coverage? Your situation may be somewhat different if you have purchased an optional type of coverage called accident forgiveness . As the name suggests, this insurance ""forgives"" you for one at-fault accident, in other words, your policy premium will not increase after a single accident in which you are found to be at fault. There are some caveats: not all insurance companies offer this type of coverage, for one thing, and even for those that do, it may not apply to every type of accident. It's also important to note that having accident forgiveness does not remove the accident from your driving record, and your state's DMV will still retain a record of it. If your accident results in civic penalties or points on your license, accident forgiveness insurance does not remove them. Do collision claims increase your premium? Understanding how collision claims affect car insurance can encourage safer driving. In general, collision claims cost insurers more than other types of claims. Therefore, involvement in a collision could result in being categorized as a higher-risk driver in the eyes of insurance companies. For that reason, it’s not uncommon for your insurance premium to increase after an accident. If you’re filing a collision claim, it may mean you collided with either a vehicle or a stationary object while driving. Hit-and-run incidents also typically fall under collision coverage, as the victim’s insurance may help pay for the damage if the at-fault driver cannot be found. In contrast, incidents that are covered by comprehensive insurance primarily involve instances when you aren’t in the vehicle (e.g., vandalism, theft, etc.). Do comprehensive claims increase your premium? Generally, filing a comprehensive claim does not increase your premium by as much as a collision claim would. If you qualify to file a claim under collision, you were likely determined to be at fault. However, filing a claim with any damages paid can be used to assess your risk when the insurance company renews your policy. So you may still see a small rate increase after filing a comprehensive claim. Frequently asked questions [accordions] How many claims can I file in a year? Generally, there is no set limit for the number of insurance claims you can file in one year. However, even the best car insurance companies may choose not to renew insurance policies or restrict coverage options if a certain number of claims were filed within a short period of time (usually three years). Can I get insurance with multiple claims in my history? Yes, you can get insurance with multiple claims in your history, even if you experienced two accidents in one year. The coverages paid out, the amount paid, the frequency of the claims filed and the determination of fault are all factors considered by an insurance company as to whether or not they will insure you. Insurers may also want any previous claims to be completely resolved before your new policy takes effect. What are other reasons my insurance company might drop me? In general, there are a few reasons why a car insurance company might cancel or choose not to renew your policy. For starters, if you are found guilty of a serious driving infraction, like a DUI, then your insurance company might consider you to be too high-risk and may decline to renew your policy. Or, there are occasions in which an insurance company will stop serving your state. If that happens, then your insurance company will drop you. And, if you choose to lie on your application and the truth is later revealed, your insurance company may choose not to renew your policy.

""" Key Takeaways: Debt consolidation puts multiple debts into a single account to make your payments easier. Debt consolidation can lower your credit score temporarily, but your score will improve if you make payments on time. Other tols like debt management plans and bankruptcy can help you manage debt. You're not alone if you’re carrying large amounts of debt across multiple credit cards and loans. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , total household debt reached $17.5 trillion in Q4 2023. Credit card balances stood at $1.13 trillion. TransUnion reported that the average debt per borrower was $6,360 as of Q3 2023. If you owe a lot of money on multiple credit cards and loans, debt consolidation can provide a way out. Unsurprisingly, there’s also a lot of misinformation and confusion about the process. What is the best way to consolidate debt? Is debt consolidation bad for your credit? Does the process really work? What are the possible drawbacks? Debt consolidation doesn’t get rid of your debt, but it can help you pay it off efficiently. You should weigh the pros and cons and know how it will affect your credit score to decide if debt consolidation is right for you. What is debt consolidation? Debt consolidation lets you to roll debts into a single account. This process can make your life easier. You can merge multiple monthly payments to different creditors and lenders into one payment to a single source. Depending on the method used, debt consolidation can also help lower your overall interest rate. You can consolidate your debt in a few ways. Personal loans A personal loan gives you a lump sum, which you can use to pay off your multiple creditors and lenders. You then repay that loan in monthly installments over months or years. Personal loans generally have a fixed interest rate. The interest rate you owe (and the amount of money you can borrow) depends on your credit score and the lender you choose. Home equity loans or HELOCs Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are secured loans that use your home as collateral: •      A home equity loan is a second mortgage (at a fixed or variable interest rate). It gives you cash equal to a portion of the equity in your home. •      A HELOC is a revolving line of credit similar to a credit card or credit line. You borrow what you need from the line of credit, repay it and use it again when needed. How much you can receive is tied to your home’s equity. Balance transfer credit cards A balance transfer credit card lets you move existing debt from various credit cards to a single card. These specialized credit cards can offer a low or zero-introductory annual percentage rate (APR). Pros of debt consolidation loans Managing your payments through debt consolidation can offer plenty of benefits , including: Faster debt repayment : The main advantage to consolidating debt is combining multiple monthly payments into a single monthly payment. This allows you to direct your payments to a single source. You won't be paying many minimum payments. This process can help reduce your debt more quickly. Lower interest rates : Depending on your credit score, you could find yourself paying a lower interest rate through a debt consolidation loan or credit card transfer . A lower interest rate means more money stays in your pocket. That extra cash could help you pay off your debt faster. Cons of debt consolidation loans It's also important to understand the downsides: Upfront costs : That personal loan or HELOC doesn’t come for free. You'll have loan origination, application fees or closing costs if you're using home equity. Balance transfer credit cards might also charge fees. These costs are either fixed or a percentage of the loan. Longer payoff terms : You could pay less per month with a debt consolidation plan. However, you might be paying this off over a longer time. If so, you might pay more in interest. Penalties for missed payments : If you miss even one payment on a debt consolidation loan, you could be dinged with a late fee from the lender or credit card company. If your payment doesn't go through because of insufficient funds, you might get a return payment fee. Once your payment is more than 30 days past its due date, your creditor or lender might report the omission to the credit bureaus. Does debt consolidation hurt your credit? Debt consolidation can negatively impact your credit score. Any debt consolidation method you use will have the creditor or lender pulling your credit score, leading to a hard inquiry on your credit report. This inquiry will decrease your credit score by a few points. However, this credit score decline is temporary. Making consistent, on-time payments on your HELOC, personal loan or balance transfer credit card will help boost your overall credit score over time. Credit bureaus like to see an on-time payment history. Those payments make up 35% of your overall credit score with FICO. On the other hand, making off-and-on payments or completely missing payments are good ways to make a mess of your credit score. Deciding when debt consolidation is a good idea When considering a debt consolidation plan, it’s a good idea to mull over a few important factors: Your credit score : One goal of debt consolidation is to reduce the interest rate on your debt. The idea here is to pay a lower interest rate on a consolidation loan or balance transfer credit card than you currently have. This is doable with a “good” credit score, which is at least 670 (FICO) or 661 (VantageScore). Your budget and financial goals : Debt consolidation could make your payment period longer. It can also provide you with a route to a specific, fixed monthly payment. This might be ideal if you’re working within a specific budget. Your ability to repay : Don't get a debt consolidation loan unless you're 100% sure you can repay it. Missing payments could drive you deeper into debt, and missed payments drag down your credit score. Alternatives to debt consolidation If you’ve realized you might not be a good candidate for debt consolidation, there are other options to help pay down your debt. Debt management plans Debt management plans are offered by nonprofit agencies that work with creditors and lenders to negotiate more favorable terms for you. You make one monthly payment to the agency, which then pays your creditors. These agencies also help you formulate and follow a reasonable budget. Debt settlement plans Through debt settlement procedures , you negotiate directly with your creditors to reduce your interest rates, monthly payments or both. You can take the reins and do this on your own, or you can have a debt relief company do much of the work for you. However, be careful when considering working with a debt settlement company, which can be an expensive option. Furthermore, based on how they operate, you could also wind up with more debt problems than you started with. Bankruptcy If all else fails, bankruptcy can provide a solution to your debt problems. On the upside, bankruptcy can cancel what you owe, helping rid you of overwhelming balances and calls from creditors. On the downside, bankruptcy means attorney fees and remains on your credit report for a long time, anywhere from seven to 10 years. Bankruptcy should be considered as a tool of last resort, only to be considered if all other attempts to reduce your debt have been exhausted. The bottom line It’s important to understand that debt consolidation doesn’t get you out of what you owe. You still need to pay your creditors and debtors. However, debt consolidation can help you redirect your financial resources and pay debt down more efficiently. The key is determining the best way to consolidate debt for your specific financial situation. Then, dedicate yourself to making on-time payments and sticking with the process. When used correctly, this process can help you successfully pay off lenders and credit card companies while improving your credit score over time. """,gpt-4,ai

Whether you're drowning in student loans, medical bills, tax obligations, mortgage payments or credit card debt, understanding debt forgiveness can be a game changer in your journey toward financial freedom. How debt forgiveness works Debt forgiveness, also known as debt relief or debt cancellation, is when a creditor pardons a debtor from part or all of their outstanding debt. Essentially, it can be a way to get out of debt without paying . Debt forgiveness occur through various ways, such as negotiated settlements , repayment plans or government programs. The goal is to help people manage their debts and financial stability. Types of debt forgiveness The type of debt forgiveness can vary depending on the type of debt you want forgiven. Here are some common types of debt that might qualify for forgiveness, along with some that usually don't. Student loan debt With the rising costs of education, many graduates face the daunting task of repaying substantial student loans. The average student owes $29,100 in student loan principal. You may have a few options for student loan debt forgiveness. These depend on your job, where you studied and how much of your loan is already paid off. For example, if you work in public service or for a nonprofit organization for a certain length of time and make regular payments, the remaining balance might be forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program or PSLF. Income-Driven Repayment plans consider your income and family size. These plans can forgive the remaining balance after 20–25 years of reduced payments. Some states and employers offer help with student loan debt. But remember, not all student loans qualify for forgiveness, especially private ones. While student loan forgiveness can be a huge relief, it's critical to understand the details of your particular loan. Pros Pay less on your student loan repayments. Several federal debt forgiveness programs are available. Some career paths may offer specialized forgiveness programs. Even partial forgiveness can provide significant relief. Cons Private student loans typically do not qualify for forgiveness. Forgiveness processes usually take time and are not immediate. Eligibility criteria are stringent. Individuals who have defaulted on loans are generally ineligible for forgiveness. Medical debt Unexpected medical expenses can accumulate quickly, leading to overwhelming debt. Fortunately, there are processes to help with this type of debt through medical bill debt forgiveness programs. If you are struggling with medical debt, reaching out to the medical facility where you incurred the debt is a worthwhile first step. You can inquire about their financial assistance policy, which is often referred to as charity care. These programs typically consider your income when determining eligibility. In some cases, the hospital may significantly reduce your bill or even forgive it entirely. It is worth noting that nonprofit hospitals are legally required to have assistance policies in place to help those in need. In 2022, the three major credit bureaus announced changes to how they report medical debt . Paid medical collections are now removed from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion credit reports. Additionally, unpaid medical collections won't appear on credit reports unless they've been in collections for at least a year. Furthermore, medical debts under $500 no longer appear on credit reports. These changes offer relief to individuals burdened by medical debt and lessen its impact on credit scores. Pros •      Even if you do not qualify for complete forgiveness, financial assistance may be available. •      Medical debt forgiveness is awarded on a sliding scale. There is no set limit for how much you need to earn. •      If you don’t qualify for forgiveness, there may be other ways to get your bill reduced. Cons •      Securing medical debt forgiveness can be time consuming and laborious, with no guaranteed outcomes. •      You may need to provide the medical institution with documentation like tax returns and pay stubs to prove your need. Tax debt Unpaid taxes can result in significant financial strain. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides several options for taxpayers facing financial hardship. One common method is the Offer in Compromise (OIC) program , which allows taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount owed. Installment agreements provide another avenue, allowing taxpayers to pay their debt over time in manageable monthly payments. Additionally, the IRS may offer penalty abatement or other forms of relief for eligible individuals. Pros •      Get immediate relief from the burden of owing taxes. •      Potentially settle your tax debt for less than the full amount owed. •      Avoid harsh collection actions such as wage garnishment or asset seizure. Cons •      Tax debt forgiveness may have implications for future tax filings, and forgiven debt may be considered taxable income. •      Engaging with the IRS can be complex and time consuming, requiring careful consideration of available options and potential drawbacks. Mortgage debt Typically, mortgage lenders are reluctant to award mortgage debt forgiveness. However, homeowners struggling to make mortgage payments may qualify for loan modifications , short sales , or foreclosure alternatives through government initiatives or lender programs. Pros •      Avoid foreclosure and its damaging effects on credit. •      Reduce or eliminate a significant portion of mortgage debt. •      Get relief from the stress and uncertainty associated with struggling to make mortgage payments. Cons •      Mortgage debt forgiveness may have tax implications, as forgiven debt can be considered taxable income in some cases. •      Homeowners may face challenges in qualifying for mortgage forgiveness programs and navigating the complex process of negotiating with lenders. Credit card debt Credit card forgiveness is a rarity. Credit card issuers typically expect individuals to repay the amount borrowed, and high-interest credit card debt can be difficult to overcome. Two options to help manage credit card debts include debt settlement negotiations or credit card refinancing (consolidation loans or balance transfers). Debt settlement involves coming to an agreement with your lender to pay an amount less than what's owed. If you can’t negotiate a decrease in your credit card debt, you can consider taking out a personal loan or opening a zero-interest credit card to transfer your balance and pay off your credit card debt. Pros •      Debt settlement negotiations allow you to reduce the amount of debt owed. •      Credit card refinancing may be available at a lower interest rate, saving you money in the long term. •      A consolidation loan simplifies your finances by reducing several credit card payments to just one monthly payment. Cons •      Debt settlement companies may charge hefty fees and could negatively impact your credit score. •      If you don’t take quick action with a debt consolidation loan, your credit card payments may become overdue, hurting your credit score. Pros and cons of debt forgiveness While debt forgiveness can offer relief from overwhelming financial burdens, it's essential to understand the potential benefits and drawbacks before you choose this path. Benefits of debt forgiveness Debt forgiveness offers several advantages that can provide much-needed relief to individuals struggling with overwhelming financial burdens. •      It offers a bankruptcy alternative, allowing individuals to resolve their debts without the expenses and long-term consequences associated with filing for bankruptcy. •      Forgiven debt often means paying less than the initial amount owed, saving borrowers money in the long run. •      Debt forgiveness can eliminate the stress of dealing with aggressive debt collectors, providing a sense of relief and allowing you to focus on rebuilding your financial health. •      By negotiating reduced settlements or payment plans, debt forgiveness empowers you to pay off your debt more quickly. Downsides of debt forgiveness Having less debt to pay off certainly sounds appealing. However, there are some negative repercussions to consider. •      Debt forgiveness may negatively affect credit scores, making it challenging to obtain future loans or credit. •      Forgiven debt of more than $600 may be considered taxable income, potentially resulting in a hefty tax bill. •      Engaging with debt relief companies could lead to additional fees, exacerbating financial difficulties. •      Debt settlement scams can trap vulnerable customers by promising unrealistic results, further complicating their financial situation. Do debt relief programs hurt your credit? While debt relief programs can provide much-needed relief, they may temporarily hurt your credit score. However, timely payments and responsible financial management can help mitigate any negative effects, ultimately leading to improved credit over time. Alternatives to managing debt If you don't qualify for debt forgiveness or simply find it's not a good fit, there are alternative debt management options to help you repay and manage your debts effectively: Debt consolidation: Debt consolidation is the process of merging multiple debts into a single loan , typically with a lower interest rate. This can simplify payments and potentially reduce overall debt. Debt settlement: Negotiating with your creditors to settle debts for less than the total amount owed can provide immediate relief, albeit with potential credit repercussions. You can do this yourself or through through a debt relief company . Credit counseling: Seeking guidance from accredited credit counseling agencies can help you create realistic budgeting strategies and debt management plans. Credit repair: If you think you can manage your debt if you have a better credit score, File for bankruptcy: In extreme cases where debt is insurmountable, filing for bankruptcy may offer a fresh start by liquidating assets or establishing a repayment plan. The bottom line Debt forgiveness can be a lifeline for individuals struggling with overwhelming debt. By understanding how it works, exploring the available options, and weighing the pros and cons, you can make informed decisions about your financial future. If you're facing financial hardship, don't hesitate to seek assistance from reputable sources, such as financial advisors or nonprofit organizations. With perseverance and careful financial management, you can overcome debt and regain your financial footing. """,gpt-4,ai
""" Hit-and-runs in Texas Experiencing a hit-and-run incident can be truly unnerving, more so when it leads to injuries or substantial damage to your automobile. If you find yourself in a situation where the other motorist flees the scene, knowing the most appropriate next steps can be instrumental in maintaining your composure and ensuring that you and any other passengers remain safe. Depending on its specifics and the particulars of the accident, your auto insurance policy may provide you with coverage for the damage incurred from a hit-and-run. Hit-and-run laws in Texas Texas car insurance laws outline in great detail what is expected from drivers after they are involved in a collision. Under Texas Transportation Code Chapter 550 , drivers in Texas who are part of a car accident involving injury or death are required to: Stop at the scene Return to the scene immediately if you were unable to stop Determine if a person is involved in the collision and if they need aid Offer aid and remain at the scene until assistance arrives Share their contact details If a driver doesn't comply with these rules, they could be charged with a hit and run. The severity of the penalty will depend on how serious the accident was. The charges can range from a simple misdemeanor to a serious felony. Monetary fines could reach up to $5,000, and the offender could face imprisonment ranging from a couple of months to as long as 10 years. It's crucial to understand that these outcomes can significantly alter the life of the driver at fault, impacting their driving record and causing their car insurance rates to increase. MAIN AUTO WIDGET How does a hit-and-run affect car insurance in Texas? A hit-and-run in Texas can have a significant impact on car insurance, especially for the driver who causes the accident. If you're responsible for a hit-and-run and caught, your insurance premiums are likely to increase significantly, and insurance companies could view you as a high-risk driver. On the other hand, if you're a victim of a hit-and-run, it generally won't impact your insurance premiums unless the responsible driver remains unidentified and you decide to file a claim under your own collision coverage. The average cost of car insurance in Texas after an at-fault accident is $3,804 per year for full coverage, which is 44 percent more than the national average cost of car insurance for drivers with a clean record. Keep in mind that the rate surcharges from a hit-and-run accident are typically higher than a standard at-fault accident due to violations that may be issued. If you cause a hit-and-run, you will likely receive a ticket for leaving the scene of an accident and possibly additional moving violations such as speeding. Insurance companies count each of these incidents separately, which increases the amount of surcharge points on your insurance policy. This can make finding cheap car insurance rates challenging in the future. What to do after a hit-and-run in Texas Knowing the right steps to take immediately after the incident can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety, the preservation of vital evidence and the successful processing of your insurance claim. Here's what you should do after a hit-and-run in Texas: Check that everyone is safe : Your first priority should be to ensure everyone's safety.

Record important information : Try to note down as many details as you can remember about the incident and the other vehicle. This may include the color, make, model and even parts of the license plate if you were able to catch a glimpse. This information can help law enforcement find the perpetrator and may be necessary in your claim filing process . Inform your insurance company : Get in touch with your insurance company to report the incident. An adjuster will guide you through the claims process and clarify your coverage options. Remember, if you have either collision coverage or uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) property damage coverage, these may come into play to cover the damage from a hit-and-run incident.

""" Does applying for a loan hurt your credit score? Key takeaways A loan application can temporarily lower your credit score due to the required hard credit check. Though this drop is temporary, it isn't the only way a personal loan can hurt your score. Personal loans can also positively impact your score over time by contributing to your credit mix and payment history, among other factors. When you apply for any type of credit, lenders must perform a hard credit check to view your credit file. This check causes a temporary drop in your credit score. Personal loans are no exception to this rule — applying for one will knock your score by a few points. But there’s an upside: Making timely monthly payments can also mean good news for your credit score over time. Your payment history , which is the largest component of your credit score, will improve. You can also boost your credit score by consolidating debt from revolving credit, like credit cards, which lowers your credit utilization ratio. Just make sure not to fill those credit cards right back up or you'll undo the progress made and have more monthly payments. How loan applications impact your credit Before approving you for a loan, lenders must first check your creditworthiness and financial health. They do this through a credit inquiry or credit check. These checks can be “soft” or “hard,” depending on the purpose of the check. Soft credit check A soft credit inquiry or check is more of a general background check than anything else, so it doesn't impact your credit. Because of this, it can be done with or without your consent. Some personal loan lenders offer soft credit checks to see what you may qualify for . This allows borrowers to view realistic offers without having to fill out a formal application and go through a hard credit check. Hard credit check When you apply for a personal loan , lenders will run a hard credit check to have access to your credit file and history. Hard credit checks temporarily lower your credit score by as much as 10 points . But if you have excellent credit, applying for a loan will most likely make your score drop by five points or less. Though your credit score will typically recover within a few months, the hard credit check will stay on your credit report for up to two years. Because of this, lenders must ask for your consent before doing this type of inquiry. Bankrate tip: You are required to submit additional documents when you apply for a personal loan, including proof of identity, employer and income verification and proof of address. Have these ready and on-hand before applying to ensure a smoother process. How personal loans could help your credit Under the right circumstances and when used responsibly, a personal loan can positively impact your credit score in a few ways: Give you a better credit mix: Adding various types of lending products to your portfolio helps keep your credit score high as long as you stay on top of payments. It is generally a good idea to have a mix of installment loans and revolving credit, as credit mix accounts for 10 percent of your FICO score. Make debt more manageable: If you use a personal loan to consolidate debt , you can generally take advantage of lower interest rates than you’d get with credit cards. With a lower interest rate, you may be able to pay down outstanding debt faster, which will improve your credit score. Boost your payment history: A personal loan can help establish a positive payment history when made in full and on time. Positive payment history makes up 35 percent of your FICO score , the largest category in determining your score. Reduce your credit utilization ratio: A personal loan does not affect your credit utilization ratio . However, using one to pay off revolving credit card debt could lower this measure, resulting in a higher score. How personal loans could hurt your credit Just like any other credit products, personal loans could potentially hurt your credit in several ways: Hard inquiry on your credit: Due to the hard credit check , you will likely see a short-term drop in your credit score when you formally apply for the loan. While this may not be detrimental to your long-term credit score, it could cause some harm to your credit if you apply for multiple loans in a short time. Late or missed payments could lower your score: If your payment is late by 30 days or more, the lender will report it to the credit bureaus. This negative mark can stay on your credit report for approximately seven years and will ding your score. If enough time has passed and the account goes to collections , your credit score could drop between 90 and 110 points. Increase your debt load: When you take out a loan, it increases the amount of debt you have. If you already have a high debt load , taking on a loan can limit your future access to credit, as lenders will see you as a greater risk. Impact length of credit history: Opening a new loan account can lower the average age of your credit. This could result in a dip in your score, as length of credit history accounts for 15 percent of your FICO score. What to consider before taking out a personal loan Before taking out a loan, consider the benefits and drawbacks of adding another monthly bill to your budget . Reason for the loan: Personal loan lenders tend to offer different interest rates depending on the purpose of your loan. For instance, personal loans to consolidate debt have a much lower interest rate compared to one used to finance a vacation. How much it will add to your monthly costs: Calculate how much a personal loan will take out of your monthly budget. If you can't comfortably afford it, you may want to hold off on taking one out. Your credit score and history: Do you have a good credit score and healthy habits with your credit? If not, you can take steps to improve your credit score by restoring some of those bad habits. Your debt-to-income ratio: Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio measures your monthly debt relative to your monthly income. Generally, the higher the DTI ratio, the less likely you will qualify for a loan. All of your options: Shopping around for the best personal loan for you is one of the most important steps to take. Each lender offers different rates, fees and conditions to account for. It's especially important to prequalify if you have less-than-perfect credit — getting the best bad credit loan rate can save you hundreds in interest. The bottom line Personal loans can be a great tool that can help you improve your credit score, consolidate debt or pay off major expenses. However, knowing how applying for a loan can affect your credit score is important. While you may experience a short-term dip when you submit your application, you could improve your credit score over the long run by making timely payments and using your loan funds to pay down existing debt. Finally, before you apply, shop around for the best personal loan rates to get the financing that fits your situation. """,gpt-4,ai

Best Egg If your credit score isn't in mint condition, Best Egg is one of the few lenders that accepts applicants with a fair credit score or better.

Qualifications for a $40,000 personal loan There are certain requirements you must meet to qualify for a personal loan. Most lenders evaluate the following before making a lending decision: Credit: Your credit score shows how well you have made payments in the past. To qualify for a $40,000 loan, you'll typically need a credit score upwards of 700 or a co-signer with excellent credit. That's because these loans involve a higher risk for the lender, so most will limit high amounts to those with solid scores . Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio: Your DTI is your total monthly debt divided by your total monthly income. Typically, the lower your DTI the better. A DTI under 36 percent is preferred by most lenders, especially when borrowing larger amounts. Documentation: When you apply, expect to provide copies of pay stubs or tax returns to verify your income. You'll also need to provide proof of ID and address, among other documents to get approved . Some lenders may be more lenient than others with these requirements and may evaluate other factors than the ones listed. Check out each of the lender's eligibility requirements before applying to ensure you meet the qualifications. Costs of a $40,000 personal loan in the long term When you take out a personal loan, you’ll repay the amount you borrow plus interest and any applicable fees in equal monthly installments. Interest rates, which are expressed as APRs (annual percentage rates) on loans and include both interest and fees, vary by credit rating, loan type and the lender you select. To illustrate how borrowing costs work, assume you take out a three-year, $40,000 loan with a 8.99 percent APR. You’ll get a monthly payment of $1,271.80 and pay $5,784.91 in interest over the life of the loan. Now, that same $40,000 loan with a five-year repayment term can cut down your monthly payment to $830.14. However, you'll pay a total of $9,808.41 in interest – over $4,000 more than if you chose a three-year term . Before taking out a personal loan, use a loan calculator to run the numbers so you’ll know what to expect in terms of monthly payments. You’ll also get an idea of how much the loan will cost you over time. How to determine if you need a $40,000 loan Taking out a $40,000 loan can significantly affect your finances. Before applying, assess why you need the funds and determine if it’s an urgent need or if you can hold off and save up. Here are some instances where a $40,000 loan could make sense: You have a viable need and want to build your credit score. Payment history is the most significant component of your credit score. By making timely loan payments, you can improve your credit health. You’ll earn a return on the money . Completing home improvement projects is often expensive, but kitchen remodels, basement conversions and energy-efficient enhancements can increase your property's value . You can save money in interest. If you're battling high-interest credit card debt, taking out a debt consolidation loan could save you hundreds — if not thousands of dollars worth of interest, depending on your rate. This can make it easier to pay off your debt faster, plus decrease your credit utilization ratio , which can improve your score. If you decide to take out a personal loan, make sure you know how much you will owe each month and have a plan to pay it back. You should also have the means to comfortably afford the monthly payments. The bottom line When considering a $40,000 loan, think about the overall cost of the loan and whether the reason behind it it's worth it. Though each lender has its own requirements, it's likely that you'll need a strong credit and income to qualify for a loan that size. Crunch the numbers with the help of a calculator to ensure you don't borrow more than you can comfortably afford. Research your options carefully and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the best loan for your needs. """,gpt-4,ai
""" Tennessee hit-and-run laws require that anyone involved in an accident stay at the scene of the incident and provide their information. Failure to do so can carry significant fines and penalties. If you were involved in a hit-and-run accident in Tennessee, find out what steps to take and whether or not your car insurance will help repair the damage. Hit-and-runs in Tennessee A hit-and-run incident is when a driver collides with another vehicle, property or individual and then fails to remain at the scene to share their details. Car insurance laws in Tennessee require car insurance providers to offer uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage (UMBI) and uninsured motorist property damage (UMPD) coverage to all policyholders. UMBI can help pay for medical-related expenses for you and your passengers, and UMPD can help repair your vehicle in the event of a covered claim. Both coverage types may apply when an at-fault driver hits you and is uninsured or unable to be identified. Policyholders can choose to reject this coverage in writing. In the event of an accident with an uninsured or unidentified driver, you would need to rely on another optional coverage called medical payments . If you make collision coverage part of your auto policy, vehicle damage caused by a hit-and-run will usually be covered up the the actual cash value of your car, minus the deductible. If you don’t have these types of coverage, however, you could be responsible for paying any out-of-pocket costs for medical bills or vehicle repairs if you are the victim of a hit and run in Tennessee. Most insurance experts recommend that drivers carry higher liability limits for better financial protection whenever possible. Hit-and-run laws in Tennessee According to Tennessee accident laws , if you cause an accident with injuries or death of another person in a public area — near a shopping center, apartment complexes or on highways — you must stop at or as close to the scene as possible, provide your information and render aid. The information you must be prepared to provide includes your name, address, vehicle registration number and insurance information. Rendering aid means you must provide reasonable assistance, including calling an ambulance to assist the victim. Additional important laws include: If it is suspected that property damage of $1,500 or more has occurred, the driver is required to notify the police about the accident. Failure to stop and provide your information to the impacted party or property owner could result in a Class A misdemeanor, fines up to $2,500, up to 11 months and 29 days in jail and driver’s license suspension. A Class E felony may result if you fail to stop despite reasonable belief that the accident resulted in death and could be punishable by up to six years in jail and potentially having your driver’s license revoked. If you are involved in a hit-and-run in Tennessee and get a ticket for leaving the scene, you could face higher insurance rates, a canceled policy or be required to carry high-risk car insurance . How does a hit-and-run affect car insurance in Tennessee? In Tennessee, a hit-and-run accident can impact your car insurance rates. If you've been the victim of a hit-and-run incident and were not at fault for the accident, you shouldn't see any significant rate changes to your policy, even if you used your UMBI and UMPD coverage. However, keep in mind that UMPD has a required deductible of $200 in Tennessee. While UMBI and medical payments do not have deductibles, collision coverage does. Some of the most popular collision deductibles are $500 or $1,000, and you will need to pay for that expense out-of-pocket to have your vehicle repaired when filing a collision claim. If you are the driver leaving the scene of an accident in Tennessee, the cost of your car insurance policy can increase drastically. Aside from being surcharged for an at-fault accident, your rate can also increase for any tickets you may receive concerning the accident, such as speeding or leaving the scene. Every insurance company has its own underwriting and rating system, and a hit-and-run accident may be rated more heavily by one company than another. To give you an example of how an at-fault accident may impact your car insurance rates in Tennessee, the average cost of full coverage car insurance is $1,897 per year. After an at-fault accident, the rate jumps up to $2,730 — a 44 percent increase. Rates following a hit-and-run are likely to be even higher as these incidents are considered higher risk than standard accidents. If you experience high rates after a hit-and-run, comparing car insurance rates between multiple carriers may hep you find a cheaper rate . What to do after a hit and run in Tennessee If you cause an accident, no matter how minor, it is best to stop as close as possible to the scene to provide your insurance information and render aid if needed to avoid being charged with a hit and run. But with a high rate of uninsured drivers in Tennessee, you may become a victim of a hit and run at some point. If you are the victim of a hit and run in Tennessee, follow these steps: Stop the car: If another driver has hit you, stop as close to the scene as is safe to do so. Assess the scene: If your car is driveable and in the roadway, move to the shoulder near the accident scene. If the car is not driveable, get out of the car if you are not injured and wait nearby to avoid being involved in another accident, especially if you are traveling a busy road. Call for help: Make sure you and your passengers are okay, and call the police, especially if the at-fault driver has left the scene, creating a hit-and-run scenario. If someone is injured, notify the police that an ambulance is also needed at the scene. Document what happened: While it is still fresh, detail the weather conditions, the location where the accident occurred and any other details you can remember. Take photos of your car from all angles. Contact your car insurance company: Even if the other person involved or responsible for the accident leaves the scene, you should contact your insurance company to file a claim and make them aware of the situation. Provide as much detail as you can to your insurance provider. If you have collision coverage or uninsured motorist coverage, you may be able to file a claim to help pay for damage or injuries. Frequently asked questions How much does car insurance cost? The national average cost of full coverage car insurance is $2,314 per year, while minimum coverage averages $644 per year. Drivers in Tennessee pay less than the national average, with an average annual cost of $1,897 for full coverage and $477 for minimum coverage. Keep in mind that these rates are estimates and your driving profile will cause your car insurance rates to be higher or lower than the Tennessee state average. Will insurance cover a hit-and-run? Insurance may cover a hit-and-run accident in Tennessee, depending on the coverage types you have on your policy. If you're the victim and have UMBI and UMPD coverage, you and your passengers could be covered for injuries, lost income or property damage. If you don't have uninsured motorist coverage, you may still have coverage under the medical payment or collision coverage on your policy. Drivers who carry liability only coverage may need to shoulder out-of-pocket expenses for medical bills or car repairs. Is Tennessee a no-fault state? Tennessee is an at-fault state , which means the driver found at fault in an accident is responsible for the injuries and property damage they cause. Most insurance experts recommend purchasing more than the state-required minimum liability insurance to better protect your finances but speak with a licensed agent if you aren’t sure what’s right for you. What is the charge of fleeing the scene of an accident in Tennessee? If you leave the scene of the accident in Tennessee, you may face a number of penalties depending on the severity of the crash and who is involved. You can face a class A misdemeanor for an accident that causes property damage or up to a Class E felony if you fail to stop after an accident that may have resulted in death or serious injury. Penalties can range from $50 in fines and 30 days in jail to up to $2,500 in fines and up to 11 months and 29 days in jail, as well as suspension of your driver’s license for more serious accidents.

""" If you need money and have a sizable amount of home equity built up, you may want to tap into that equity for the funds. Both a cash-out refinance and a home equity loan allow you to borrow against your ownership stake, using your home as collateral. A cash-out refinance is the process of replacing your existing mortgage with a new one, while a home equity loan is a second mortgage you take out on top of your primary one. If you’re weighing A cash out refinance vs. a home equity loan: How do you decide which is the better option? Here are the benefits and risks to consider for them both. Cash-out refinance vs. home equity loan Cash-out refinance Home equity loan Fixed or adjustable interest rate Fixed interest rate Lower interest rates, comparable to mortgage rates Higher interest rates, 2-3% above mortgage rates Must maintain 15% - 20% home equity Must maintain 15% – 20% home equity Interest is tax-deductible on original mortgage principal; cashed-out portion deductible if used on the home Tax-deductible interest, provided funds are used to “buy, build, or substantially improve” the home Longer application process Shorter application process What is a cash-out refinance? A cash-out refinance pays off the remaining balance on your first home loan and replaces it with a new mortgage. The newly refinanced loan amount is for the remaining debt owed on the first mortgage, plus the amount you’re “cashing out” — that is, borrowing — from the equity. The loan term is generally up to 30 years, and the interest rate — which can be fixed or variable — will reflect prevailing market rates. Cash-out refi rates tend to be a bit higher than traditional rate-and-term refinance rates. Some lenders and federal programs may set lower credit score requirements for cash-out refinancing. Because the refinancing lender assumes the first mortgage during a cash-out refi, that lender becomes the primary lien-holder in the event you default. With easier access to your home as collateral, lenders might be willing to offer lower rates compared to what you’ll get with a home equity loan. Pros Lower credit requirements One loan rather than multiple loans May boost credit score Lower interest rates than other types of debt Can be used for any purpose Cons Risk of foreclosure Long application process At least 20% home equity stake required Closing costs can be high Low debt-to-income ratio required Potential fees associated with a cash-out refinance Closing costs for cash out refis typically range from 2 percent to 6 percent of the loan's amount. C ash out refis usually cost less than primary mortgages, as they don't require certain expenses, like title searches and title insurance, that are common when buying a home. But you can expect to see certain familiar fees: The lender will likely charge you for an appraisal of the property, for example. What is a home equity loan? A home equity loan has a variety of uses: a way to fund big-ticket purchases, make costly home upgrades and consolidate high-interest debt. It’s a second mortgage against your home with its own terms and interest rate that are separate from your first mortgage. By refinancing using a home equity loan, you’re borrowing against the home’s equity — the difference between the appraised value of your home and what you owe on your mortgage. You can typically borrow up to 85 percent of your home’s equity. However, your loan amount depends on other financial factors, like your income and credit history, and the size of your first mortgage. Home equity loans typically have a repayment period of up to 30 years, just like mortgages. Home equity loan rates may be higher than those of refis. The differences, however, vary significantly from lender to lender and over time. Pros Fixed rates offer certainty Lower rates than unsecured loans Long repayment terms/low monthly payments Interest can be tax-deductible Use the cash for almost any purpose Cons Foreclosure risk: home is collateral Higher credit requirements 15%-20% home equity required Must be paid off when home is sold Easy to overborrow due to lump sum distribution Potential fees associated with home equity loans Home equity loan fees vary a good deal, depending on the lender, highlighting the importance of comparing offers. While some lenders waive origination fees — often a big chunk of total closing costs — they may implement a slightly higher interest rate as compensation. And it's likely that, as with the refi, you'll have to pay for an appraisal and various administrative fees. In general, though, home equity loan closing costs tend to be lower than those for a refi, working out to 2 percent to 5 percent of the loan principal. That's partly because you may incur fewer costs, but also because you're likely borrowing a smaller amount, so percentage-based expenses — like origination fees — will be less. When does a cash-out refinance make sense? Cash-out refis generally have lower interest rates and are easier to qualify for, making them appealing for people who have less-than-perfect credit scores. They offer an option for homebuyers to borrow a lump sum for planned expenses, with only a single repayment to track. However, they replace your existing mortgage with a new one, meaning a new payment term and interest rate. You’ll have to pay new closing costs , too. If you got a great deal on your initial mortgage, you might not want to give it up if rates have substantially risen lately. Or, if you’ve had your mortgage a long time, and your payments are now primarily going towards principal (not interest), you might not want to reset the amortization clock with a new loan. A cash-out refi also tends to make sense if you were thinking of swapping out your current mortgage anyway — perhaps because of a big drop in interest rates. Also if you can get a better rate on a new mortgage than you have on your existing one or, you want to adjust the repayment term of your loan. When does a home equity loan make sense? Home equity loans let you keep your existing mortgage and add a new loan on top. That can be helpful if you got a good deal on your original mortgage and want to keep it for as long as possible. Or just don’t want to mess with it, in general. A home equity loan is an option for those who’ve paid down a good chunk of their mortgage and built up a lot of equity in their homes, and who have a strong credit history and score. The overall process of taking out a home equity loan can be simpler and quicker than a cash-out refinance, too. If you r financials ensure you'll get a good rate on the loan — one that's competitive with refi rates —   land you're able to find a lender that waives most closing costs, a home equity loan could be the right choice. Cost comparison: 15-year cash-out refi vs. 15-year home equity loan The table below compares the costs of a cash-out refinance with that of a home equity loan. In this scenario, the refi comes out cheaper, despite its higher closing costs. This is because the cash-out refinance interest rate is significantly lower than the home equity loan rate's. 15-year cash-out refi 15-year home equity loan Loan amount $150,000 $150,000 Closing costs $2,400 $600 Interest rate 5.5% 7.25% Monthly principal and interest $1,225 $1,369 Total cost in first 24 months $31,800 $33,456 Total cost in first 48 months $6,200 $66,312 Total cost in first 60 months $75,900 $82,740 Bottom line on cash-out refi vs. home equity loan If the cash-out refinancing vs. home equity loan contest, remember that both are strategic ways to access the equity you’ve built in your home. However, you have to consider your financial situation, goals and how you plan to use the funds to determine the best approach. It’s equally important to consider the qualification criteria for both options to gauge which you’re most likely to get approved for. Always shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders regardless of which path you choose. Also, request an itemized list of lending fees from the lender you choose so you can calculate how much the loan will cost. FAQ How often can you do a cash-out refinance? There is no limit on how many times you can refinance your home, but you typically have to wait at least six months between cash-out refinances. This is called a “seasoning” period. Different lenders have different requirements. How does a cash-out refinance affect taxes? A cash-out refinance is considered a loan, not income, so you will not have to pay taxes on the money you receive. Your cash-out refinance may be eligible for a tax deduction if you use the money to make permanent improvements to the home. This could include projects like putting in a swimming pool , adding a bathroom or upgrading the heating and air conditioning system. What is a no-cash-out refinance? A no-cash-out refinance is the process of refinancing your home for less than or the same amount that you owe on your mortgage, plus closing costs on the new mortgage. This type of refinancing allows you to transfer to a loan with better terms and a lower interest rate, but you do not get any additional funds. How long does it take to get a home equity loan? Getting a home equity loan can take anywhere from one week to two months, but most lenders advertise an average window of two to six weeks. What can a home equity loan be used for? A home equity loan can be used for virtually anything you want, but it is most commonly used to consolidate debt or finance remodels or renovations. Because these loans tap into your home’s equity, it is smart to use the funds for home improvement, increasing the value of your home. However, it is important to use the funds wisely and make sure you don’t take out more than you need. If you can’t pay back the loan, you may lose your home. What are other alternatives to home equity loans and cash-out refinance s ? One other option that relies on your home equity is a home equity line of credit (HELOC). HELOCs give you more flexible access to your equity, letting you draw funds multiple times whenever you need to. However, they usually have variable interest rates, which means your payments can be unpredictable. You can also consider unsecured loans, like personal loans. These have faster application and approval processes , but lower limits and higher interest rates. Additional reporting by Linda Bell """,gpt-4,ai

If you feel you were wrongly ticketed — for instance, if you were speeding due to medical necessity or believe that law enforcement recorded your speed inaccurately — you can try to fight the ticket by appearing in court. Otherwise, you can pay your fine without appearing, which amounts to pleading guilty to the citation. Once you've dealt with the ticket, take steps to avoid a major insurance rate hike by shopping around for a cheaper carrier . Fight your Wyoming speeding ticket To fight your ticket, you'll have to appear in court. Look for information on your ticket about the municipal or circuit court that issued the ticket and contact them to schedule a hearing. If you choose this option, you'll need to prepare a clear argument and be prepared to show evidence that you weren't speeding. At the hearing, the law enforcement officer who issued your ticket will also have an opportunity to present evidence, such as video or radar data, to support the citation. Consider a defensive driving course In Wyoming, you may be permitted to take a defensive driving course in order to have your ticket dismissed. Ask the court if this option is available to you and consider taking the course to avoid having your speeding violation added to your driving record. Pay your speeding ticket fine In most cases, paying a speeding ticket fine is the quickest and most affordable way to resolve a speeding citation. You can pay your ticket online or follow alternative payment instructions listed on your ticket. Shop around for cheaper insurance Not all car insurance companies handle speeding convictions in the same way. While some carriers may impose steep surcharges for drivers with speeding tickets, others may not consider them as much of a risk factor. Keep in mind that your speeding record will be considered in tandem with other rating factors in your profile, making comparison shopping an essential step to save money after a ticket. Compare rates from at least two or three companies and look into discounts that could reduce your costs while your speeding ticket surcharge stays on your policy. Frequently asked questions [accordions] What is the best car insurance company for drivers with a speeding ticket?

Shop around and consider multiple quotes, along with third-party reviews and expert ratings, before settling on the best carrier for your profile. Is it hard to find insurance with a speeding ticket in Wyoming?

Comparison shopping can help you identify the carrier with the lowest rate increase based on your new risk profile. Do I have to tell my insurance company about a speeding ticket? Yes, you should tell your insurance company about your speeding ticket. Insurance providers will find out about your ticket when they review your motor vehicle record (MVR) during the policy renewal process, so you won't be able to hide your citation from your insurer. If you're shopping around for a new policy, your prospective carrier will also review your MVR before finalizing your premium, so it's in your best interest to disclose any driving record blemishes during the quoting process. How long does a speeding ticket stay on your record in Wyoming? A speeding ticket typically stays on your insurance record for three to five years, but each company will treat your ticket differently. In some cases, you may see the surcharge removed from your policy earlier than five years.

Key takeaways VA loans are mortgages guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, available to eligible veterans, active-duty service members and surviving spouses. VA loans can be used to purchase a primary residence, refinance a current mortgage or cover renovation costs. VA loans offer several benefits, including no required down payment, no private mortgage insurance (PMI) and competitive interest rates. A VA loan is a great option for you if you’re a qualifying active-duty military personnel, veteran or surviving spouse. They often have more relaxed financial requirements than conventional loans, requiring no down payment or private mortgage insurance. They also typically have lower interest rates than FHA and conventional loans. Here’s a breakdown of what VA loans are, how they work and how you can get one. What is a VA loan? A VA loan is a loan guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA does notprovide these loans, instead, mortgage lenders offer VA loans, knowing that the government guarantees them. This makes lenders more confident in lending, often offering a VA loan with a lower interest rate than a conventional mortgage . The VA doesn’t officially set a credit score requirement for these loans.  Rather, lenders set their own criteria which typically range from a minimum score of 580 to 640. VA loans don’t require a down payment, which can make homeownership more attainable for those who qualify because you’ll need less money upfront. How does a VA loan work? Getting a VA loan is similar to securing a conventional loan. Basically, you fill out paperwork from the VA that verifies your eligibility for the program. You also receive what’s known as your entitlement, which is the dollar amount guaranteed on each VA loan. While VA loans technically have no loan limit, lenders might be willing to loan up to four times the amount of your entitlement. You can get a VA loan with no money down and, unlike other loans, you won’t have to pay for mortgage insurance. That’s because the government guarantees your loan. However, you’ll need to pay a funding fee, which ranges from 1.25 percent to 3.3 percent of the loan amount. The fee applies whether you are buying a home or refinancing, if you are making a down payment and how much it is and if it is the first time you've obtained a VA loan.  This fee keeps the program functioning so future veterans and service members can use it. VA loan eligibility The VA sets service requirements for active-duty military personnel and veterans to qualify for a VA loan. You can check the full eligibility requirements on the VA’s website , but the basics are: You’re currently on active military duty, or you’re a veteran who was honorably discharged and met the minimum service requirements. You served at least 90 consecutive active days during wartime or at least 181 consecutive days of active service during peacetime. Or, you served for more than six years in the National Guard or Selective Reserve. If your spouse died in the line of duty, you may qualify for a VA loan. You should also keep these VA loan requirements and rules in mind: VA loan limit: As of 2020, if you have full entitlement, there is no limit on the size of your loan. However, your lender may impose its own terms, and your entitlement will still be pegged to conforming mortgage limits. You do have a home loan limit if you have remaining entitlement: You have an active VA loan you’re still paying back; or you paid a previous VA loan in full and still own the home; or you refinanced your VA loan into a non-VA loan and still own the home; or you had a compromise claim (or short sale) on a previous VA loan and didn’t repay it in full; or you had a deed in lieu of foreclosure on a previous VA loan; or you had a foreclosure on a previous VA loan and didn’t repay it in full. If you have remaining entitlement, your VA home loan limit is based on the county loan limit where you live . This means that if you default on your loan, the VA will pay your lender up to 25 percent of the county loan limit minus the amount of your entitlement you’ve already used. Check your county loan limit here . Property type/condition: Investment properties and vacation homes cannot be purchased using VA loan proceeds. Furthermore, you must occupy the home and use it as your primary residence. The property must also meet certain safety and structural standards. Credit score: The VA does not specify a minimum credit score requirement. However, borrowers might have a hard time getting approved by a lender if they don’t have at least a 620 FICO Score. Income: Borrowers need to show they have the income to make the mortgage payments. It’s equally important to not have a huge debt load since the lender will assess your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), or the percentage of your monthly income that’s spent on debt payments. Assets and down payment: There is no down payment requirement for VA loans, but the lender may have overlays (or specific criteria) that mandate a down payment in place for borrowers with lower credit scores. Reserve funds: Many lenders require borrowers to have an adequate amount of reserves — generally two to three months of mortgage payments — before clearing you to close on your loan. Learn more: VA home loan requirements for 2024 How to apply for a VA loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE) The first step to geting a VA loan is obtaining a VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) , which proves you meet the requirements for a VA loan. You can get the certificate by applying through your eBenefits portal online or applying through your lender. To apply, you need to provide some data based on your current status. Veterans need to provide a DD Form 214, and active-duty service members need a signed statement of service. A statement of service should include: Full name Date of birth Social Security number The date you started duty Any lost time Name of the command providing the information Different requirements may apply for National Guard or Reserve members, as well as surviving spouses. You can find more information through the VA’s benefits website, or by speaking to a qualified lender. VA home loan pros and cons For those who are eligible, VA loans have many benefits, but they also have drawbacks to consider. Pros of a VA loan Some of the key advantages of VA loans include: Lower borrowing costs: VA loans can be cheaper than their conventional mortgage counterparts. No down payment: VA loans allow you to purchase a home with zero down payment, making homeownership more accessible for those who may struggle to save a large lump sum. You need at least 3 percent down for a conventional mortgage. No mortgage insurance: Unlike many other types of mortgages , VA loans do not require you to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) , potentially saving you hundreds of dollars per month. Competitive interest rates: Because the government guarantees these loans, lenders are able to offer lower interest rates than you’d typically find with conventional loans. Capped lender fees: The VA limits lender fees (like loan origination fees) to 1 percent of the loan amount. This can result in lower closing costs than other loan types. Cons of a VA loan Despite the many benefits, VA loans also have a few downsides to consider: VA funding fee : VA loans come with a funding fee that can vary depending on your military category, down payment amount and whether you’ve previously used a VA loan. You can finance this fee into the loan amount, adding to the total cost of the loan, or you can pay it upfront at closing. Limited to primary residences: You can only use VA loans to purchase a primary residence, not vacation homes or investment properties. However, you can buy up to a four-unit property with a VA loan as long as one unit is your primary residence. Not all properties qualify: Not every property will meet the VA’s minimum property requirements (MPRs), which can limit your potential housing options. Longer closing process: The VA loan process can take slightly longer than other loan types due to extra steps such as the VA appraisal. Types of VA home loans Whether purchasing a home or refinancing a mortgage, there are a variety of VA loan options available : VA loan type Description VA mortgage Allows qualified service members to purchase a home with no minimum down payment. VA construction loan Eligible service members can use this loan to build the home of their dreams. VA rate-term refinance Allows service members without an existing VA loan to change their loan term or secure a lower interest rate. VA cash-out refinance Allows service members to swap their conventional mortgage with a VA loan, with an option to turn home equity into cash if needed. IRRRL loan Allows service members to replace a VA mortgage with a VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL) , which can offer lower interest rates. It can also be used to change from an adjustable-rate loan to a fixed-rate loan . VA rehab and refinance Can be used by service members to finance the cost of improvements made to the home. VA jumbo loan Allows service members to finance a home with a sales price exceeding the conforming loan limits. Native American loan Available to Native American veterans to help them purchase, build, improve or refinance a home located on federal trust land. What is the VA loan limit? A VA loan limit is the maximum amount of money that can be borrowed without having to make a down payment. In 2020, the VA dropped the limits for veterans, service members and survivors with access to their full entitlement. However, for those with remaining entitlement, the standard loan limit in 2024 is $766,550 in most counties. In more expensive areas, that limit can go up to $1,149,825. Refinancing a VA loan If you're interested in refinancing a VA loan, you might want to explore the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL) . Commonly known as a VA streamline refinance , the loan doesn't have the usual requirements of a typical refinance, like a home appraisal or credit check. However, there is a funding fee involved, namely 0.5 percent of the loan amount, which you can incorporate into the loan along with your closing costs. Streamline refinances are offered by many, but not all private banks, mortgage firms or credit unions. Another option is a VA cash-out refinance . Unlike a conventional cash-out refinance, the loans typically have lower rates, as they are guaranteed by the government. VA cash-out refinances are only available for people who qualify for a VA loan. Usually, an appraisal or income verification isn't required, but just like with a streamline refinance, you are on the hook for closing costs and the funding fee. How to apply for a VA loan To get a VA loan, you'll need to: Obtain a COE. Gather your financial paperwork (pay stubs, bank account statements etc. ) Look for lenders that offer VA loans. Get approved for a VA loan through at least three lenders. Compare each lender’s offer and choose the best option. Shop for a home and submit an offer. Have a seller accept your offer and get a signed purchase agreement with the seller. Get a VA home appraisal and inspection. Work with the lender through the underwriting process , promptly responding to questions and requests for documentation. If you’re struggling with your VA loan, there’s extra help available. The VA can help you negotiate with your lender if you can’t make payments. With the help of the VA, it’s possible to avoid foreclosure through loan modification or other repayment plans. Call 877-827-3702 if you need help. VA loan FAQ What are the terms and rates for VA home loans? VA loans can have term lengths of 10 to 30 years. In addition, they can be fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). The interest rates for VA loans are typically lower than those for conventional loans, mainly because the VA guarantees a portion of the loan, which reduces the risk for the lender. These rates change frequently, so check Bankrate’s VA home loan rates to compare offers from different lenders. What are VA entitlements? A key feature of VA loans is the entitlement. This is the amount of the loan that the VA will guarantee to the lender if you default. There are two types of entitlement: Basic entitlement: Up to $36,000 for loans worth less than $144,000, or 25 percent for loans of that amount or more. Bonus entitlement: Up to 25 percent of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) loan limit, minus the basic entitlement. If you’re purchasing a loan that costs more than $144,000, the bonus entitlement can be used. Do VA loans require PMI? No, VA loans don’t require PMI or any other mortgage insurance . That’s because the VA loan entitlement usually amounts to more than 20 percent of the home’s value. However, while you won’t need to pay for mortgage insurance, you will have to pay a funding fee. What are the costs associated with VA loans? As with any mortgage, different lenders have various closing costs. You might need to pay for discount points, a credit check, VA appraisal fees, title insurance and other costs, including local and state taxes. While you don’t have to worry about PMI, you do have to pay a VA funding fee. Your VA funding fee depends on the size of your VA loan down payment, and whether it’s your first-time use of the benefit. Down payment First-time use Subsequent use 0%-5% 2.15% 3.30% 5%-9.99% 1.50% 1.50% 10% or more 1.25% 1.25% So, while a VA loan down payment isn’t required, it can save you money to make a down payment. Quick note: Disabled veterans who receive disability benefits are exempt from the VA funding fee. Also, it’s possible to wrap your VA closing costs into the loan amount. However, that increases how much you need to borrow and can cost you more. """,gpt-4,ai

""" 5 things to know before opening a CD Written by Rene Bennett Edited by Marc Wojno If you’re looking for a low-risk place to invest, you might be considering an account type known as a certificate of deposit (CD). CDs are made for saving money, but they’re different from savings accounts and come with a unique set of variables and terminology. In this guide, you’ll learn everything to know about CDs before opening an account, from what an annual percentage yield (APY) is to when a CD is better than a savings account. 1. CD terminology Someone new to investing in CDs may find themselves somewhat disoriented by all the terminology specific to these types of accounts. Here’s a breakdown of the essential words and phrases you’ll need to understand before exploring CD options. Annual percentage yield (APY) The annual percentage yield (APY) is an important aspect to understand when it comes to CDs: It indicates how much money you’ll earn. Specifically, the APY refers to the compounded interest rate for one year. The higher the APY, the more money you’ll make. While APYs and simple interest rates for CDs typically are the same, it’s still important to look for the APY above all else, since some accounts may compound more frequently. Interest rates for CDs may compound daily, monthly or quarterly. Those that compound more frequently will produce higher earnings. Term length A CD term is the length of time that your money will be left in the account. For example, if you open a CD with a one-year term , your money will stay in the account for one year and grow at the designated APY until the maturity date. The maturity date is simply the end date of the term — when the account holder can withdraw the total balance, including earnings. Financial institutions typically have many term options, so you can choose the term that best fits your needs and goals. Principal balance The principal balance of a CD is the amount you initially deposit into the account. Basically, it’s the total balance of the account minus earnings. Most CDs have a minimum deposit requirement, meaning that your principal will be at least that required amount. Renewal Some CDs may come with an option to automatically renew or roll over into a new CD. This means that once the CD matures, it will start a new term with the new total balance if the money isn’t withdrawn within a specified amount of time, typically a few days. Early withdrawal penalty The majority of CDs are locked in for the designated term length, so you won’t have access to the principal or earnings until the end of the term. This is enforced by an early withdrawal penalty, which is a fee you incur if you withdraw any of the funds before the end of the term. The fee may be the amount of interest earned over several months or a fixed dollar amount, which can even eat into your principal. While most CDs have an early withdrawal penalty, there are some that allow you to make withdrawals before the maturity date, referred to as no-penalty CDs. Fixed vs. variable rates Most CDs have a fixed rate, meaning that the APY will not fluctuate at all during the entire CD term. This is helpful if rates start to decline, because a fixed rate CD won’t be affected by falling rates. While it’s not very common, there are some banks with variable rate CDs. These CDs give you the opportunity to take advantage of rising rates, but they also come with more risk. If rates start to fall, you’re stuck with a lower rate until the CD matures. 2. Specialty CDs A standard CD comes with a fixed interest rate, an early withdrawal penalty and only allows a single, initial deposit. Specialty CDs are those that differ from any of the standard CD features. Some of the most common types of specialty CDs include: No-penalty CDs : A no-penalty CD is simply one that allows you to withdraw money from the account one or more times before the maturity date without paying a penalty fee. These CDs give you more flexibility with your funds, but they may have lower rates than other CDs. Bump-up CDs : A bump-up CD gives you an opportunity to increase the CD’s rate of return. If rates increase, you can ask the bank to increase your CD rate. Usually, you can only take advantage of one rate increase per term. Step-up CDs : Similar to bump-up CDs, step-up CDs give you a chance to take advantage of increasing rates. However, rather than the account holder requesting a rate increase, the bank will automatically raise the interest rate by a predetermined amount. Callable CDs : Callable CDs typically earn higher interest rates than standard CDs, but they come with an extra risk factor — the bank may cut short or “call” the CD before the term is up. This can happen if rates start dropping. Add-on CDs : Unlike other CD types, an add-on CD allows you to make one or more deposits after the initial deposit. That way, you can continually grow your savings as more money becomes available to you to invest. Jumbo CDs : A jumbo CD is largely the same as a standard CD except that it has a higher minimum deposit requirement, usually $100,000 or more. The average rate on jumbo CDs is slightly higher than the average rate for standard CDs. 3. Investing in multiple CDs When it comes to investment strategies, sometimes investing in multiple CDs can open up more opportunities for getting higher rates, having more flexibility and diversifying your portfolio. Two common CD investment strategies are CD ladders and the barbell strategy. A CD ladder involves investing in several CDs with staggered term lengths, so that the CDs will mature at different intervals and allow you to have access to some of your money before the last CD matures. With this strategy, you can take advantage of the higher rates usually offered on longer CD terms without locking up all of your money for that amount of time. It also allows you to reinvest the money from the shorter-term CDs if rates go up, since not all of your money is locked in at a fixed rate for multiple years. For example, you might create a CD ladder with four CDs over the course of four years. Each CD term is one year longer than the previous one, so that you can redeem one CD every year. A barbell strategy is similar to laddering but with less regularity. Instead of having multiple CDs that gradually mature over the course of several years, you deposit half of your money in a short-term CD and half in a long-term CD. You might even open several short-term and several long-term CDs. The aim of the barbell strategy is to take advantage of higher yields on long-term CDs, while also having a pool of money that’s more quickly accessible to you through the short-term CDs, which can be used for reinvesting and potentially keeping up with rising rates. 4 . How inflation affects CDs Inflation increased 0.4 percent in February, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) release published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the last 12 months, inflation increased 3.2 percent. The top CD rates for a one-year term have surpassed 5 percent, which is much higher than the inflation rate. This means that, for now, money in a CD with that a high yield will outpace inflation. However, CDs earning less than 3 percent won't grow at the same speed as prices are rising. As such, high-yield CDs with fixed rates — meaning the rate will stay the same for the duration of the term — are much safer than some other types of investments, though they may pay less. Another benefit of CDs is that they’re covered by federal insurance, so long as you open an account with an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union . But while inflation has been slowing, 60 percent of the nation's top economists don't expect inflation to hit the Fed's 2 percent target until 2025, according to a Bankrate survey . 5. When to choose a CD over a savings account CDs are designed for specific types of savings goals and investment preferences. Some conditions under which a CD might be a better investment than a savings account include: You already have an emergency fund in a more liquid account . Having an emergency fund should be prioritized above all else. It ensures that you can pay for unexpected expenses and sustain yourself during a loss of income. It’s best to keep an emergency fund in a savings or money market account, where you can easily access the funds when they’re needed. Only after your emergency fund has been established should you consider opening a CD. You’re saving for a specific, shorter term goal . Since CDs come at set terms, they make for good investments for savings goals you want to achieve by a planned date. For example, you might want to open a one-year CD to save for a wedding or vacation in one year. CDs might not be a great investment for a longer term goal, such as retirement. The CD rate is higher than the savings account rate . CDs can often offer higher rates than savings accounts as a reward for committing to leave your money in the account for the term. However, many savings account rates , particularly online savings accounts, have seen significant increases recently, and the gap between savings and CD rates has become much smaller. You can comfortably meet the minimum deposit requirement . If you have more money to spare and want to earn a guaranteed rate on it, a CD might be a good place to invest. CDs usually have higher minimum deposit requirements than savings accounts. How to open a CD To open a CD , you'll first need to find the bank and CD that are right for you. Ideally, find a CD that's outpacing inflation with a term length that's suitable to your financial needs (i.e., a period of time you don't expect you'll need that money). Once you've done that, go to the bank or credit union's website and open the account using an online application. You'll need information about yourself, likely including your social security number and government-issued ID. Bottom line Understanding the language and strategies used for CDs can help you better evaluate how to make the most of a CD. Some of the variables you might want to consider before opening a CD include APYs, term lengths, fees for early withdrawal and how CD rates compare with inflation. Also, make sure to find a bank that’s FDIC-insured, or a credit union that's NCUA-insured, so the money you lock away is federally protected. --Bankrate staff writer Marcos Cabello updated this article.

""" If you are one of the many Americans that carry a balance on your credit card, you should keep an eye on your card’s interest rate to manage how much you pay your issuer for the privilege of using the card. What you may not know is that, on a federal level, there is no cap on the amount of interest a credit card company is allowed to charge. However, cardholders can find a bit of security in the federal Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act ( CARD Act ) and in usury laws, which set interest rate limits on a state-by-state basis. Is there a maximum interest rate for credit cards? The short answer to this question is “no.” However, the longer answer is “it’s complicated.” For one, the CARD Act, signed into law in 2009, provides card users with protections and greater disclosures relating to billing statements, interest rates , due dates and penalties for credit cards. The CARD Act made it so that card issuers have to be more transparent about introductory interest rates , mandating that they be offered to the consumer for at least six months. The CARD Act also obliges card issuers to give cardholders at least 21 days’ notice before a bill’s due date and 45 days if their interest rate or fees will increase. Another big change the CARD Act made was that card issuers must get a cardholder’s permission to process a transaction that takes the cardholder over their spending limit in a way that would incur a fee. The CARD Act definitely offers cardholders a bit more security, but it doesn’t control interest rates or how high they may reach . What it does is oblige your card issuer to notify you at least 45 days ahead of time that a change will come. This notification will give you the option to cancel your card if you are not agreeable to the rate increase. That said, you can always ask your issuer for a lower interest rate. It’s important to note, though, that this may trigger a hard inquiry into your credit report, and there are no guarantees that the rate will be lowered. The CARD Act does, however, require card issuers to review interest rate increases (including those initiated because of a change in a consumer’s credit risk or change in market conditions) every six months and reduce a cardholder’s rate if it is appropriate. Any reduced rates due to the review may not extend to increases in your rate caused by penalties, although penalty rates are also subject to review at least once every six months. What are usury laws? Usury refers to the practice of charging a very high interest rate that is deemed unreasonable. Usury laws set a limit on the amount of interest that can be charged on different kinds of loans. While most states have usury laws, national banks can charge the highest interest rate allowed in the bank’s home state — not the cardholder’s. So while you may live in Arkansas where the maximum interest rate is 17 percent, your card issuer can charge you a higher amount if it has its headquarters in a different state with a higher maximum rate. And if your issuer is based in a state like Maine, which has no usury laws, you have even less protection. In some circumstances, a national bank can even take recourse to the higher interest rate of a state where it has branches, rather than using the rate in the state where it is based, irrespective of the state where the consumer lives. According to Christopher L. Peterson, a professor of law at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and usury law expert, “In effect, what that really meant is that there are virtually no interest rate limits that are applicable to any type of bank, anywhere in the country, anymore.” How do usury laws impact maximum interest rates? Each state has a different approach to usury law and the maximum interest rate that lenders can charge. Usury laws may not always apply to maximum interest rates for different types of loans. For instance, if you’re in South Carolina , the legal maximum rate of interest is set at 8.75 percent, but at 18 percent for credit card debt. However, usury law is not always so black and white. Many states defer to contract law instead of usury law. For example, in Hawaii the usury law sets the interest maximum at 10 percent, but a written contract can override that maximum. This is also the case in other states, including Arizona, Utah and Texas. Another bit of fine print to check for is exemptions, since credit card lending may not be bound by usury laws. For example, in California the maximum annual interest rate on consumer loans is 10 percent. However, the law states that banks and similar institutions are exempt. This is also the case in Florida, Minnesota, and New Jersey, among others. And then there is Colorado where a rate above 45 percent is deemed usurious for non-consumer loans. However, the rate for consumer loans is capped at 12 percent unless they are “supervised loans,” which includes credit card debt, made by a “supervised lender.” These loans are capped at 36%. If you want to know what the usury law is for your state, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors offers state-specific information . Just keep in mind that your card issuer is not obliged to follow the usury law for your home state. Protections for military personnel There are also laws that protect those serving in the armed forces , and their dependents, from high interest rates. The Military Lending Act caps credit card interest rates at 36 percent for those who enjoy this law’s protections. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act also caps interest rates on any credit card debt incurred by an active service member prior to entering military service at 6 percent. What to do about high interest rates If you are dealing with a high interest rate, there are some things you can do to help ease your burden. For starters, you can talk to your issuer to try to negotiate a lower rate . If this doesn’t work out, there is also the possibility of transferring your balance to a card with a lower interest rate. Just remember that balance transfers are great tools, but they aren’t magic. A repayment plan and budget go hand-in-hand with balance transfers. If you want help figuring out your repayment plan, you could use Bankrate’s credit card payoff calculator and home budget calculator to crunch the numbers. If paying off your high-interest debt seems out of your reach, you can also seek help from a debt counselor. There are debt management organizations out there that can step in to negotiate on your behalf with your credit issuer, many of which are non-profit groups. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling is a good resource to find debt management services in your area. Additionally, there are other steps you can take to better manage and get out of debt , including consolidating the debt. The bottom line If you are a cardholder carrying a balance, it is in your interest to keep an eye on the finance charges you are paying your card issuer. There is no federal regulation on the maximum interest rate that your issuer can charge you, though each state has its own approach to limiting interest rates. State usury laws often dictate the highest interest rate that can be charged on loans, but these often don’t apply to credit card loans. If you are facing the burden of high rates, you could negotiate with your lender or take other steps to better manage your credit card debt. """,gpt-4,human
""" In almost every state in the U.S. (New Hampshire is the exception), drivers need to have a minimum amount of car insurance to drive on public roads legally. This generally consists of bodily injury liability and property damage liability, but may include other types of coverage as well, depending on the state. Minimum insurance is generally cheaper than full coverage, which includes collision and comprehensive insurance, but if you have a lease or loan, you may be required by your lender to have the more robust options that you get with full coverage. What kind of car insurance am I required to have? Nearly all states have some form of car insurance requirement. Many states allow drivers to satisfy minimum requirements in several ways, including through a bond, deposits, evidence of self-insurance or by carrying an auto insurance policy. New Hampshire does not have a car insurance requirement but you do have to prove that you can be financially responsible for damages that you cause before forgoing a policy, and there are minimum limits if you choose to buy coverage. There are several states, like Michigan, Minnesota and New Jersey, where drivers are required to carry liability and personal injury protection coverage. Below are the coverage types that are often required with minimum car insurance: Bodily injury (BI) liability : If you cause an accident with another driver or pedestrian, bodily injury liability coverage will help pay for medical expenses related to the other person’s injuries. It may also cover your legal fees if the other person sues you for their losses. Property damage (PD) liability : Property damage liability coverage is designed to pay toward property damage that you cause to others. For example, if you hit another vehicle on the road, your property damage liability insurance could help pay for the other vehicle’s repairs. Uninsured/Underinsured motorist coverage (UM/UIM) : Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage offer financial protection in the event that you get into an accident with a driver who is uninsured or does not have enough coverage to pay for your losses. Personal injury protection coverage (PIP) : Personal injury protection is a requirement in states that have no-fault laws. If you get into an accident, PIP can pay for your medical bills, lost wages, rehabilitation costs and related expenses, regardless of who caused the accident. This coverage can also be purchased in some at-fault states. Medical payments coverage (MedPay) : Medical payments coverage may help pay your medical expenses following an accident and is not typically as robust as PIP. It is generally considered optional coverage. However, a few states do require drivers to carry medical payments coverage. The minimum amount of coverage per person and per accident is different depending on your location. To find the exact minimum coverage auto insurance requirements in your state, you can visit your state’s Department of Insurance website or contact your auto insurer. Minimum car insurance requirements in each state Although insurance carriers will not sell you a policy with less coverage than the state-mandated minimum coverage level, it may still be a good idea to review your state minimum coverage car insurance requirements. Also, remember that you can always purchase more coverage than required if you want additional financial protection. Most insurance professionals recommend getting quotes for multiple coverage levels before choosing the minimum amount of car insurance coverage available in your state to save on auto insurance premiums . The table below includes the minimum car insurance requirements in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Minimum BI limits are 10/20 if you do purchase coverage. **New Hampshire does not require car insurance, but these are the minimum limits if you buy a policy to satisfy the financial responsibility law. ***New Jersey limits are based on the “standard policy” minimum coverage requirements for current coverage. These limits reflect the increase that took place in January 2023. New Jersey’s minimum limits will increase again in January 2026, to 35/70/25 for liability and 35/70 for UM/UIM. PIP will remain at $15,000. ****Policies effective on or after Jan. 1, 2025 will have increased coverage minimums of 50/100/25. What states do not require car insurance? Traditional car insurance is not mandatory in all states. Depending on where you live, there may be alternative options, such as putting down a deposit or posting a bond with your state’s DMV, which serves as proof of financial responsibility. If you were to get into an accident, that money could be given to the other driver to compensate them for their losses, depending on the circumstances. The most flexible state for car insurance alternatives is New Hampshire . In New Hampshire, drivers are not required to carry auto insurance, except in cases where they must have an SR-22 . Here are a few other states that provide the option to use a financial filing in lieu of a traditional auto insurance policy: California : Option to put down a $35,000 deposit Florida : Drivers can decline liability insurance by proving a net worth of at least $40,000 Montana: Option to post a bond or a $55,000 deposit of cash or securities However, keep in mind that forgoing traditional car insurance is usually a much more expensive option in the long run or if you are involved in an accident. For example, in New Hampshire, minimum liability insurance costs an average of $321 per year. Although car insurance isn’t required here, drivers are still liable for property and medical damages related to an at-fault accident, which could easily add up to much more than that. Most insurance professionals recommend higher policy limits than the minimums required by law for greater financial protection, and you may need full coverage depending on your situation. Car insurance is designed to protect your finances from the fallout of vehicle accidents, so having a policy that fits your needs — even if it’s more expensive than the minimum requirements — may save you from financial devastation should the worst happen. Frequently asked questions Is it better to get minimum coverage or full coverage? Almost all states require you to carry a certain amount of minimum coverage. This generally includes liability insurance and may include other types of coverage, such as PIP or medpay. This coverage may be enough to pay for damages or injuries in a minor accident, but might not provide enough coverage if you are in a significant crash. Liability coverage only covers the other driver and their passengers, as well as their cars or other property. If you wish to have coverage for your own vehicle in an at-fault crash, you will need a full coverage policy, which includes comprehensive and collision insurance. If you can afford it, many insurance experts recommend that you purchase more than the minimum amount of coverage required in your state, to give you an added level of protection. Higher levels of liability coverage, plus collision and comprehensive, will give you a more robust policy that may protect you more thoroughly in the event of a serious accident. What does minimum coverage car insurance cover? Minimum coverage car insurance will help pay for the injuries and property damage you cause if you’re the driver in the at-fault accident. In some states, minimum coverage car insurance also includes PIP and uninsured motorist coverage, which can help pay for your injuries in a variety of scenarios. It’s also important to note that unless your state requires uninsured motorist property damage coverage, minimum coverage car insurance doesn’t pay to repair your vehicle, whether you’re at fault or not at fault. Instead, you’ll need to add comprehensive and collision if you want your car covered. What does a full coverage car insurance policy include? A full coverage car insurance policy generally includes liability insurance and your state’s other minimum coverage requirements (if applicable), plus collision and comprehensive coverage. Collision insurance covers your vehicle’s repairs after an accident, whereas comprehensive coverage covers your vehicle’s repairs after a non-collision incident, such as theft, vandalism, storm damage or damage from striking an animal. How much does car insurance cost? The cost of car insurance may vary greatly for every driver. The average cost of car insurance in the U.S. is $2,014 per year for full coverage and $622 for minimum coverage, according to Bankrate’s study of quoted annual premiums for 2023, but your rate may be more or less than the average. That’s because the premiums you pay are calculated using a range of personal factors , like your ZIP code, state, claims history, driving record, coverage options and deductibles. I lease my vehicle. Why can't I get minimum coverage car insurance? When insuring a leased vehicle , your leasing company will typically require you to carry a minimum of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident in bodily injury coverage, and $50,000 in property damage coverage (or 100/300/50). Because the leasing company still technically owns the car during your lease term, it may require these higher-than-minimum liability limits for extra financial protection if you’re deemed at fault in an accident.In addition to 100/300/50, your leasing company will probably require that you carry comprehensive and collision, and it may restrict how high you can set your deductible. Leasing coverage requirements vary from company to company, so to ensure your policy meets the terms of your lease agreement, you may want to consult with your dealer or leasing company for more information. Does my minimum coverage car insurance cover me in another state? Yes, your car insurance policy will cover you anywhere you drive in the United States. Your car insurance policy must meet the coverage requirements in the state where the car is registered. However, there are no restrictions for driving in another state where the minimum requirements are higher; if you drive into a state that has higher minimum limits than yours, your minimum coverage policy will adjust up to that state’s limits. You may even have the same coverage if you drive across the border into Canada. However, you should confirm with your car insurance company or agent that you are covered in Canada prior to driving across the border. Most standard U.S. auto policies do not provide coverage in Mexico. """,gpt-4,human
""" Having a savings account as a teenager can help young people get into the habits of saving money and setting financial goals. Even if an account is opened with a very small amount, your teen’s money can grow quickly as they add funds over time and earn compound interest. What’s more, those who work can build up their balance by transferring a portion of each paycheck from checking to savings. Best savings accounts for teenagers Various savings accounts are designed to help young people earn a competitive yield on their money, while avoiding maintenance fees and minimum balance requirements. Best for the highest APY on all balances Capital One Kids Savings Account $0 minimum opening deposit 2.50 percent APY Capital One is an online bank, but it also has a brick-and-mortar presence. Its Kids Savings Account, which is available to children until they turn 18 years old, offers the same yield on all balances. You don’t need to make a deposit to open the account, and you won’t be charged a monthly service fee. What to watch for: This is a joint account that needs to be opened with an adult. Once the minor account holder turns 18, they become a joint holder with equal privileges as the adult joint holder. Best for the highest APY on a limited balance BECU Early Saver Youth Savings Account $0 minimum opening deposit 6.17 percent APY on the first $500 (0.5 percent APY on balances of $500.01 or more) Boeing Employees’ Credit Union (BECU) has more than 50 locations in Washington and two in South Carolina. BECU doesn’t require a minimum opening deposit for the Early Saver Youth Account. The account is available to teenagers until they turn 18 years old. What to watch for: The higher APY is only available on balances up to $500. Balances above that amount will earn the lower APY. You can’t apply for this account online. You’ll need to meet certain criteria to be eligible to open an account at BECU. Those who live, work, worship or go to school in Washington state can qualify for membership. Also eligible are residents of select counties in Oregon and Idaho, as well as those who belong to partner associations. Best for older teenagers Bethpage Student Savings Account $5 minimum opening deposit 5 percent APY on the first $1,000 (1.39 percent APY on balances of $1,000.01 or greater) Bethpage Federal Credit Union was founded in 1941 for people working at Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. Now, it’s open to anyone who opens a savings account, with a minimum of $5. The credit union’s Student Savings pays a competitive APY on the first $1,000, while the portion of your balance above that amount earns a lower APY. The account is available to those who are age 20 and younger, and those who are older than 18 can open the account without a parent or guardian as a joint owner. Bethpage also offers a Student Savings Custodial account that’s available when either the custodian or the minor is a resident of New York. Governed by the New York Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (NYUTMA), the account is controlled by a custodian (such as a parent or grandparent), who is responsible for distributing the funds to the minor when he or she reaches the age of majority. What to watch for: You’ll need to open a $5 savings account to become a member of Bethpage Federal Credit Union. Also, the high APY only applies on the first $1,000 that you have in your Bethpage Student Savings. Best features to look for in a savings account The best savings accounts for teenagers offer some common features: High APY: The annual percentage yield (APY) of an account is its rate of return, factoring in the effect of compound interest. The higher the APY , the more interest you’ll earn on your money. No minimum balance to open the account: Many teens aren’t starting out with much, which makes it important to find an account that can be opened with either no minimum or a very small amount. No minimum balance to maintain the account: It’s often best to go with an account that doesn’t require you to stay above a certain balance. No monthly service fees: It’s better to learn banking without having to worry about maintenance fees depleting your savings. Some savings accounts that normally charge fees will waive them for those who are under the age of 18, or who link a checking account from the same bank. What to consider when opening a teen savings account Decide whether a joint or custodial account works best for your situation. A joint account gives you and your child access, while a custodial account allows you to manage the account for the child. Also, find out how the account will be handled when your teen reaches 18. Account restrictions might end, or the account will convert to an adult account. Minors usually need an adult to open an account Teens under age 18 will probably need a parent or guardian to open a savings account. This adult will be designated as a joint account holder . Children’s accounts are converted to standard accounts When a bank offers special accounts geared toward children or students, it typically will automatically convert those accounts to its standard savings account once the child reaches a predetermined age — which is often 18 or 21. When such a conversion happens, it’s a good time to determine if the new account is the best place for one’s money, by considering factors such as APY and any maintenance fees. Bottom line The best savings accounts for young people can feature a competitive APY, require no minimum balance and charge no maintenance fees. The right savings account, combined with a checking account and the use of a debit card , can help teens and young adults develop healthy money habits and save for future goals that may include college and homeownership. --Bankrate's Sheiresa McRae Ngo contributed to an update of this article.

""" Key takeaways Monetary gifts, including cash, gift cards, and money orders are a convenient option. These gifts can be personalized to suit a recipient's preferences or needs. Understand the tax implications of monetary gifts. Gifts like stocks or contributions to 529 plans come with specific tax benefits and considerations. Consider alternative gift options such as CDs or savings accounts. These gifts not only provide financial value but can serve educational purposes, teaching recipients about saving, investing, and financial planning. Whether it’s a special occasion like a graduation or an annual celebration like a birthday, figuring out what gift to give can be hard. Giving a cash gift can make that decision easier and guarantee your gift will be put to good use. But how can you give monetary gifts without seeming like you put in minimal effort? Here are some options to help personalize your giving and ensure the most thoughtful gift for each person on your list. 1. Gift card If you know your gift recipient well, find their favorite store or restaurant and buy a gift card to treat them to something you know they’ll love. Even if they’re harder to shop for or you’re not very close, there’s nothing wrong with choosing a prepaid cash card. Pair it with a heartfelt note to show how much you care. If you’re still wary of coming across a bit too impersonal, try giving an experience instead. Prepay for a couple of movie dates or a trip to the spa where you can spend time together and enjoy a nice treat. Benefits You may score a bonus for yourself when you buy a gift card for a loved one, especially during the holiday season. Many restaurants and retail stores offer a bonus card near the end of the year for you when you spend a minimum amount on a gift card for someone else. You can also often score discount gift cards for less than face value through sites like GiftCards.com or find redemption bonuses through your credit card’s rewards portal, like Chase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership Rewards . Taxation If you, as an employer, give a gift card to an employee, it may be taxable as income depending on the specific circumstances of the gift. However, like cash, gift cards given by a friend or family member generally fall under the gift tax exemption, so unless you give more than $18,000 worth of gift cards per person in 2024, it won’t be taxed. You also shouldn’t be charged sales tax when buying a gift card, since your recipient will pay sales tax on the item(s) they purchase with the gift card. 2. Cash When all else fails, stick to the basics. Give your cash gifts flair for the occasion by dressing them in a card or money holder. For the extra creative, there are countless ideas online for inventive ways to give cash: You can find guides to DIY anything from dollar bills frozen inside giant ice cubes to cash-filled chocolate candy boxes. Or keep things virtual by transferring your gift funds into your recipient’s Venmo or Cash App account. You may lose some points in presentation, but person-to-person (P2P) payments still give you the opportunity to put your emoji keyboard creativity to the test. It’s also a much faster transfer process for long-distance giving than mailing a check. If you know someone with international travel plans, you can personalize your gift by gifting cash in a currency they’ll be able to use abroad. That could also help them save on hefty exchange fees and ensure they’re prepared with some usable cash upon landing. Benefits The biggest benefit of giving cash is simplicity. Though there may be occasions for which giving cash can seem inappropriate or a faux pas, it’s also a straightforward gift that you can give and be assured your recipient will use it, rather than regift at a later date. Taxation Cash given as a gift is not considered taxable up to the annual exclusion, which is $18,000 for 2024 , according to the IRS . If your gift is under this amount, your recipient won’t be responsible for paying taxes on it. The exclusion is applicable for each person gifted, so you can give up to $18,000 per person per year without being taxed on the gifts. 3. Check or money order If you choose to give a check, make sure there is enough money in your bank account to cover the requested funds. Insert the recipient's name in the “pay to the order of” section. Don’t forget to include your signature and make sure the correct amount is listed and on the check. You can purchase a money order at banks, credit unions, cash-checking stores, some retail stores, and the post office. Make sure to hold on to your receipt. If the money order gets lost, this will help establish proof of purchase. Benefits A check or money order provides a secure way to give money. Your gift can be tracked and voided if lost or stolen, which offers an added layer of safety. Another benefit is the convenience. You can write a check from your bank account and money orders are widely available at banks, retail stores and more. Furthermore, money orders are a great option if the recipient needs money right away. A check gives you the choice of stopping payment if necessary. Taxation Gifts below the annual exclusion amount are not taxable . If you give above the exclusion amount, the IRS requires the submission of a gift tax return (Form 709). Recipients typically don’t pay taxes on gifts since a gift is not considered income. 4. CDs or savings account transfer Giving the gift of a certificate of deposit or savings account and using it as a teaching tool can be helpful for younger children and teens. With these accounts, it’s easy to teach someone to save money every so often. And it’s a gift you can build upon year after year. Start by teaching the value of saving money, explain how interest works with a CD and then escalate to teaching them how they can earn more over time with savings bonds or other investments. Benefits Not only are you putting away money now for your gift recipient to use in the future, you’re also teaching valuable personal finance habits that can help them earn more throughout their lifetime. Currently, the best one-year CDs and high-yield savings accounts earn upwards of 4 percent interest. Do your research beforehand to find a bank offering a minimum balance and term length that works best for you and the recipient. Taxation Interest earnings on CDs and savings accounts are taxable . The owner of the account will receive a Form 1099-INT with information on interest earned that year from the bank or credit union. Your CD or savings account interest is taxed at the same rate as your income. 5. Stocks Giving a piece of ownership in a company, in the form of shares of stock , is another option. Before you dive in, though, take some time to consider the gift recipient. For adults, you can simply submit a transfer form to your financial institution to transfer your own shares into their account or transfer a mutual fund to someone with an account at the same institution. If you have individual stocks in mind, you can also purchase shares with popular companies on websites like GiveAShare . If you want to give a stock to a minor, though, you have to create what’s called an UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) account, which is essentially a custodial account where the adult manages the money. When the child reaches majority age, then the money is theirs to use however they like. But consider whether a custodial account is actually the best option. In some cases, and depending on the size of your gift, setting up a trust or opening a 529 college savings plan , in which parents can retain more control, may be more effective. Benefits Stocks can be an instructive gift for teaching the value of investing, or simply a fun way for your recipients to own a share of a company they admire. The biggest benefit of giving stock is the possible gains your money may deliver to the gift recipient over time. But for the right recipient, it can also be a useful opportunity to educate them on how the stock market works and how money is earned in stocks via capital appreciation and dividends, and watch it grow over time. Taxation Depending on whether you’re gifting your own previously held stock or purchasing new stock and what type of account it’s held in, you or your recipient may be liable for capital gains and other tax obligations. Because there are several different ways you can give stock and different tax implications for each (for both you and your recipient), consider speaking with a financial advisor or accountant beforehand to determine the best giving options. 6. 529 contribution If you’re looking to invest in the future of a child in your life, you can contribute your money to a 529 plan , which may be used in the future to pay for education expenses like tuition, textbooks and other supplies. Whether your friends recently had a baby and you want to help establish a college fund or your niece or nephew is nearing graduation age, 529 plans are great tax-advantaged investments. Benefits A 529 plan may not be the most exciting gift to a young child, but it can pay off exponentially in the future, especially as student loan debt continues to rise. There is no limit to the number of 529 plans you’re allowed to set up, and you can name anyone as a beneficiary. Typically, 529 plans are not counted as a student asset when filling out the FAFSA forms for financial aid, so it won’t be counted against your recipient’s financial merit-based aid awards. That noted, it must be reported as an investment asset of the parent on the FAFSA form. You can also transfer unused 529 funds to someone else, if the original beneficiary decides against pursuing higher education. Taxation A 529 plan is a sound way to begin tax-advantaged savings for a child’s education. Your contributions are made after tax, but the money grows tax-free and is not taxed once it’s removed from the account for qualified education expenses. And though there aren’t federal deductions for contributions, many states do offer tax credits or deductions. 7. Charitable contribution For those times when you’re still left wondering what to get the person who truly has everything, a monetary donation to a charity or cause they support can be a great way to show you care. Familiarize yourself with the causes your recipient champions and make a donation in their name. When it’s time for the gift exchange, you can simply give a card with a message about the donation. Some charities provide these thank-you cards themselves and may even specify where exactly your donation will go. Benefits Donating to a cause in someone’s name can easily solve your gift indecision for the people in your life who truly seem to have it all. Not only are you helping to aid a cause you and your recipient care about, but you may even inspire others to pay it forward with a donation of their own. Taxation Charitable donations, in addition to doing good for a worthy cause, are also one of the most advantageous gifts for your taxes. Cash donations to qualified charities and nonprofit organizations are tax-deductible if you choose to itemize your deductions as long as the donations do not exceed 60 percent of your adjusted gross income . Tips for giving money as a gift Put security first whether gifting money online or in person. Only use trusted payment methods like direct bank transfers or well-known payment apps. Also, make sure the recipient's information is accurate. If you give cash in person, take steps to conceal the money so that safety is maintained. Bottom line There are many ways to give money as a gift, and with so many options to choose from, you really can’t go wrong. Giving a gift card or cash is pretty straightforward, but if you’re giving something like stocks or CDs, you’ll need to mind the taxation question. Then weigh the interests of your giftee, and you’ll ensure your gift is thoughtful and well received. Former Bankrate reporter Kendall Little wrote a previous version of this article.

""" Five years ago, the Federal Reserve got entangled in what’s basically one of the world’s most important pawn shops: “the repo market.” Short for repurchase agreements, the repo market is a complicated, yet important, area of the U.S. financial system where firms trade trillions of dollars’ worth of debt for cash each day. The activities on this market keep the wheels turning on Wall Street and the broader economy. To further illustrate just how important it is, the Fed in July created two new permanent standing repo facilities — one for domestic authorities and another for international firms — to ensure that this corner of the financial system chugs along smoothly. That’s almost 23 months after the Fed first learned the hard way that dysfunctions in the repo market can come with disastrous consequences, when a technical glitch in September 2019 caused short-term interest rates to surge well above the Fed’s target range. That occurred again at the onset of the pandemic, when jittery investors started dumping Treasury securities in a quest for cash and prompted U.S. central bankers to inject a series of short-term loans into the system totaling $1.5 trillion. Even today, with the economy on the mend , the Fed isn’t off the hook — though it’s facing the opposite problem. Banks, money market funds and other key financial players are buying up Treasurys from the Fed, looking for a place to park their cash overnight, as short-term funding rates hold at record lows. But the Fed’s involvement is complicated. Experts say it’s an important part of ensuring things don’t go from bad to worse, but it’s still managed to raise some prominent peoples’ eyebrows over the years, including those of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Here are the main things you need to know about the repo market, including what it is, why it’s a big part of the Fed’s coronavirus response and how it could impact you. What is the repo market? To understand how these operations impact you, it’s first important to learn some of the basics on how the repo market works. The repo market is essentially a two-way intersection, with cash on one side and Treasury securities on the other. They’re both trying to get to the other side. One firm sells securities to a second institution and agrees to purchase back those assets for a higher price by a certain date, typically overnight. The contract those two parties draw up is known as a repo. Essentially, it’s a short-term collateralized loan. And just as most loans come with an interest payment, you can think of the difference between the original price and the second, higher price, as the “interest” paid on that loan. It’s also known as “the repo rate.” On the flip side, when the Fed sells a security to a counterparty and then agrees to buy back that security, it’s a transaction known as a “reverse repo.” Why would two parties want to participate in a process as antiquated as the repo market? Because it ultimately benefits them. Financial firms with large pools of cash would prefer to not just let that money sit around — it doesn’t collect interest, meaning it doesn’t make any money. On the other side, it allows financial institutions to borrow cheaply to fund short-term needs. There’s also (typically) not much risk involved. Experts estimate that around $2 trillion to $4 trillion of debt are financed here each day, meaning it’s vital to the overall functioning of the financial system. The cash that institutions receive goes toward funding daily operations. Experts have offered up a wide variety of analogies meant to explain how the process works. Some refer to it as the plumbing of the financial system, while others call it the market’s beating heart. Why exactly did the Fed get involved in the repo market? But that work exists largely in the background. You probably don’t think about the amount of work that your heart is doing every day, as it pumps an estimated 2,000 gallons of blood throughout your body . You do, however, start to notice it when things go wrong. And in such cases, you probably need a first responder. That’s where the Fed comes in. The Fed’s involvement in the repo market as we know it can be traced back to Sept. 16, 2019, when a traffic jam occurred at the intersection of cash and securities. Experts say that piles of cash flowed out of the system because corporate tax payments came due. That happened right as new Treasury debt settled onto the markets. Financial institutions wanted to borrow cash to purchase those securities, but supply didn’t match those demands. All of that worked to cause a cash crunch, and the repo rate soared — reaching as high as 10 percent intraday on Sept. 17. In other words, banks didn’t want to part with their cash for anything lower than that rate. It pushed up the federal funds rate along with it, which was supposed to be trading in a target range between 2-2.25 percent at the time. The Fed was also days away from making a second rate cut. Yet, largely in the background, the Fed had also been shrinking its balance sheet and selling off the large holdings of assets (which included mortgage-backed securities and Treasurys) that it’d purchased in response to the 2008 financial crisis. “The general theme that caused the repo market volatility has been almost a decade in the making,” says Jon Hill, vice president on the U.S. Rates Strategy team at BMO Capital Markets. Fed researchers surveyed major financial institutions to determine what level of reserves would be enough to be considered “ample,” but nobody knew for sure just how many reserves needed to stay in the system. Just as quantitative easing (Q.E.) increases the amount of bank reserves in the system, the opposite process of selling off assets vacuums them out. All in all, the Fed took about a trillion dollars out of the system. The repo market’s dysfunction showed that officials might’ve taken the process too far. “I don’t believe for a second that you can take nearly a trillion dollars out of the system and something’s not going to go bump in the night,” says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate chief financial analyst. “What we saw in the repo market was a direct result of that.” What the Fed does when the repo market is dysfunctional The Fed’s antidote to repo market dysfunction is stepping in as a key transactor, with the U.S. central bank conducting both repo and reverse repo operations to keep the federal funds rate in its target range. That process is spearheaded by the New York Fed, which leads the U.S. central bank’s open market operations. When the repo market saga first began last fall, the New York Fed in September 2019 injected $53 billion worth of cash in exchange for short-term Treasury bills, its first overnight repo market operation since the financial crisis. Those purchases were then listed as assets on the Fed’s balance sheet until they’re paid back. And when the coronavirus crisis came along and Treasury markets started seizing up even more, the Fed’s intervened in a way that would make those operations look like breadcrumbs. On March 12, 2020, the Fed said it would offer $500 billion in a three-month operation . The following day, the Fed planned to inject $1 trillion more, split between a three-month operation and a one-month operation. It was prepared to offer up to $1 trillion every subsequent week. “These changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak,” the New York Fed said in a statement. In more extreme circumstances, the Fed can also decide to start organically growing its balance sheet again to help calm the dysfunction. That’s exactly what it did in October 2019, long before the coronavirus pandemic was on anyone’s mind, when U.S. central bankers feared that they’d taken their balance sheet drawdown too far. The Fed began purchasing shorter-term Treasury bills at a pace of about $60 billion per month and then bought up to $20 billion each month to replace maturing securities. All of that led to the balance sheet growing in size again, recovering about half of what it initially sold off. Though the process looks like Q.E., it’s technically different. That’s because the operations were not designed to stimulate the economy and push down long-term rates but to get markets well-oiled again. How this impacts your finances When the Treasury market doesn’t function properly, it has broader implications for the U.S. economy. Firms can’t get bonds off their books, meaning they suddenly don’t have the capacity to fund short-term financing needs or to make more loans. Strains like this impact borrowing costs for mortgages and other types of consumer loans. That’s the main reason why the Fed’s repo operations are so important. When credit dries up, it makes it harder for businesses and firms to get access to a much-needed loan. And during a recession, that can be the difference between a firm staying afloat — meaning workers still get their paychecks — or ultimately failing. It all makes its way back into the economy one way or another. “The idea was just to get the markets functioning again,” says Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. “In a normal course of business, you expect that you’ll be able to borrow what you need to operate normally, and when that flow of liquidity starts to dry up, then what you see is firms are forced to liquidate. That can feed on itself.” How long will the Fed keep intervening? The volume of overnight repo agreements reached zero back in July 2020 after nearly a year of volatility. The Fed for months had already been engineering a smooth landing by slowly and gradually withdrawing support. The New York Fed in May 2020 first started scaling back the frequency of its operations “in light of more stable repo market conditions,” conducting overnight repo operations at a pace of once per day instead of twice and reducing its three-month repo operations to once every two weeks instead of once a week. The Fed officially concluded those one-month operations on Feb. 9. That could, of course, change at any time. The New York Fed has said in its open-market trading desk statements that it “will continue to adjust repo operations as appropriate to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample” and to support smooth short-term money markets. Yet, as the Fed winds down one aspect of its repo operations, another is experiencing record activity. The Fed’s reverse repo agreements — where the New York Fed’s open market trading desk sells Treasurys to investors in exchange for cash — has soared to all-time highs in 2021, with those financial firms parking more than $1 trillion in funds at the Fed in every overnight operation since August. One reason for the recent rush could be the Fed’s decision this year to raise the overnight reverse repo agreement size to a maximum of $80 billion and boost the interest rate the U.S. central bank pays on those agreements to 0.05 percent from 0 percent. With interest rates low and liquidity excessive in the marketplace thanks to the Fed’s massive asset purchase plan, financial institutions are jumping at the opportunity to earn extra money on the cash that they have sitting around. Fed officials in June indicated little concern over the recent surge, saying in records of that meeting that “concerns about the functioning of short-term funding markets had diminished” thanks to the Fed’s adjustments. Still, analysts say demand for this facility may continue, especially as Washington extends its negotiations over the debt ceiling. Given that the Fed’s repo operations are meant to prevent interest rates from soaring too high, those reverse operations are a way to prevent rates from falling too low. Why has the Fed’s repo operations drawn criticism? Anytime the Fed arrives to Wall Street’s rescue with mounds of cash, it’s going to lead to some pushback. Part of that reasoning is because it seems like an experimental policy, with the risks not fully realized. “Part of my thinking is that the Fed and other central banks have gone on this wild experimental policy for the past decade on zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing,” says Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes. “My idea all along was, those are very risky policies put in place to help a sputtering economy.” But another reason is because the operations are so complicated, it’s led to a fundamental misunderstanding of how they work. For example, the $1.5 trillion injection became a major talking point for Sanders and Warren on the 2020 presidential campaign trail. The Democratic senators have compared those short-term loans as the equivalent of handing out free money to rich investors, wondering why the money couldn’t instead be used to provide free healthcare or cancel the trillions of dollars in student loan debt. It’s important to understand that these operations aren’t taxpayer funded, nor do they prevent money in the federal government’s budget from being used elsewhere. The process isn’t really printing money at all: It’s a short-term loan that has to be paid back. “It puts reserves into the banking system temporarily,” Griffiths says. “It’s not necessarily printing physical cash.” Regardless, experts say it’s going to be important for the U.S. central bank to describe what it’s doing and why, the more involved the Fed gets in handling the crisis. “This points to the importance of communication for the central banking community to explain actions in the modern operating framework,” Hill says.

""" Small business loans are accessible through banks, credit unions and online lenders. But with so many options, choosing a lender for your small business can take time. To narrow down your list of options and find the right fit for your business, consider each lender’s eligibility criteria and reputation. Also, if it’s an option, get prequalified with the best small business lenders you’re considering and compare loan quotes to make a wise financial decision and find the best small business loan for your business. Factors to consider when choosing a small business lender It’s always responsible to compare lenders and terms before you sign on the dotted line for financing. You’ll want to educate yourself on what you qualify for and how quickly you need the money, among other factors. 1. Consider your needs How much are you looking to borrow? If you haven’t yet decided on a loan amount , you’ll need to assess your cash flow and unmet needs to determine a figure. Once you have a number in mind, use a business loan calculator to determine how much you can actually afford to borrow. It’s equally important to choose from the types of small business loans available to you. Depending on your revenue and desired loan amount, you’ll find that some loan options are more ideal than others. Bankrate insight While many small business loans have funding limits in the millions of dollars, many lenders offer smaller business loan amounts. Smaller loan amounts can also be more attainable if you’re a startup or have poor credit. If you’re looking for a smaller amount, check out our guides: Best small business loans under $100,000 Best small business loans under $5,000 2. Consider your qualifications Each lender has its own eligibility criteria that vary by loan product. That said, you should keep these general guidelines in mind: Credit score. Most lenders have a minimum credit score requirement for small business loans, often considering a FICO score of 670 or higher a good score. Some will also check your business credit score , particularly if you’re pursuing a large amount. Debt-to-income ratio. Lenders also assess your debt-to-income ratio to determine if your company is in a financial position to handle more debt or if it’s overextended. A good rule of thumb is to keep your DTI to around 36 percent, though lenders may accept higher. Time in business. You’ll generally need two or more years in business to qualify for a business loan from a bank. However, some lenders will consider you for funding if you’ve been established for at least six months. Annual revenue. Lenders also typically have yearly minimum revenue requirements you must meet to be considered for a small business loan. These typically fall between $100,000 and $250,000. When evaluating lenders, ask about their specific requirements for the loan products you’re considering. You may find that some are more stringent than others and may or may not be a good fit for your company. Bankrate insight Some lenders offer small business loans to startups, though many require six months in business to get approved . It’s also possible to get a business loan with bad credit , but the lower your credit score, the fewer lender options are available. Online lenders may accept a FICO score as low as 500, but minimum credit guidelines vary from lender to lender. 3. Consider lender type Now that you’ve calculated how much funding you need and understand eligibility guidelines, it’s time to learn where to get small business loans. You can choose from several different types of small business lenders. You can secure financing from a traditional bank, credit union, nonprofit or online lender. Here’s a rundown of the different lenders and the features and loans to expect from each: Type of lender Loans offered Description Bank or credit union Term loans, lines of credit and equipment financing Offer attractive interest rates and generous loan terms. But eligibility guidelines are often stringent, and funding times can be slow. SBA-approved lenders SBA loans, including 7(a) loans, microloans, 504 loans, Express loans Offer government-backed loans with long repayment terms and competitive interest rates. Community-based lenders and nonprofits, such as CDFIs or MDIs Term loans, SBA loans and microloans Help business owners in underserved communities that have historically lacked access to capital. Designed for underserved small business owners, these lenders are more accessible even if you have credit score challenges. They may offer smaller loan sizes than traditional banks. Alternative lenders , including online, direct and peer-to-peer lenders Short-term loans, microloans, bridge loans, lines of credit, invoice factoring and merchant cash advances Offer flexible eligibility guidelines. They may also let you prequalify with a soft or no credit check. Bankrate insight The SBA has approved over $15 billion in 7(a) loans so far in fiscal year 2024. To learn more about these loans, check out the following guides: SBA loan interest rates What is the SBA 7(a) loan program? SBA loan denied: What to do next 4. Consider lender reputation and customer service You can learn a lot about a lender based on the experiences of past and current customers. Check online reviews from Trustpilot and complaints on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) platform to determine if most of the feedback is positive or if there is cause for concern. For example, a government action against a company listed on the BBB profile may be a red flag. Consider positive and negative reviews that provide specific feedback. Some lenders promote their online profiles to encourage customers to leave a review, which can lead to generic statements about their experience. You can also ask other small business owners which lender they used and what their experience has been. 5. Consider the application process Many lenders offer online preapproval or prequalification that only requires a soft credit check and won’t hurt your credit score. If there’s a match, you can view potential loan offers, including terms, interest rates and monthly payments. A hard credit inquiry will be generated if you decide to move forward or if getting prequalified isn’t an option and you apply to view loan offers. It can dip your score by a few points, but your credit score should rebound relatively quickly. Questions to ask when choosing a small business lender Review the loan quotes you receive and compare them to choose the best small business loan for you. When evaluating each option, consider the following: Which lender offers the lowest interest rate? Is the interest rate fixed or variable? Does the lender charge an origination fee? Is there a prepayment penalty if you decide to repay the loan early? Are interest rate discounts available if you enroll in automatic payments? Can you apply online, or do you have to visit a physical branch? How fast can you receive funding? Can you manage the loan online? Is collateral required? Does the loan term and monthly payment work for your company’s budget? Is in-person support available, or are you limited to online or phone support? Ultimately, the lender you select should be reputable and offer the lowest borrowing costs available to you. Their application process and funding timelines should also meet your needs. Applying for a small business loan The final step is to formally apply for a loan. Be sure to gather any documents they’ll need before applying to expedite the processing of your application. You can apply online with many lenders, but some — particularly banks — require you to visit a branch or schedule a phone call to move forward. Either way, after submitting your application, you’ll hear back from the lender with a decision or request for additional information or documentation needed to process your application. Online lenders generally provide a decision in minutes or within the same business day. Expect to wait a few days with most traditional lenders. Once the lender issues the final approval, you’ll review and sign the loan documents. The lender will then close the loan and disburse the loan proceeds to you. Bottom line Not all business lenders are the same. So, before applying, it’s worth exploring your options. Start by understanding your unique needs and general funding guidelines. Also, familiarize yourself with what to expect from each lender and get prequalified with at least three lenders that meet your needs to ensure you get the best deal on financing. Frequently asked questions about choosing a small business lender What lenders offer the best small business loans? When evaluating small business lenders, consider their offerings, eligibility guidelines and funding times. Large banks tend to offer the best interest rates on loans, but they may have strict eligibility for small business lending. Online lenders can be more lenient with approval requirements and fund quickly but watch out for fees and high interest rates. How do I know which business loan is right for me? Identify your unique funding needs to decide which business loan is best for your company. You should be clear on how much you need to borrow, how you’ll use the funds and how much time you’ll need to repay the loan. What is a good APR for a business loan? It depends on the type of business loan you select. However, the best rates are generally reserved for borrowers with good or excellent credit. So, it’s worth improving your credit score if it’s on the lower end to qualify for attractive loan offers. How do I choose an SBA lender? Use the SBA’s Lender Match tool to find SBA-approved lenders in your area. The lenders you’re matched with will depend on your industry, the age of your business and the amount of funding you need. Interested lenders will reach out within two days to discuss your funding needs, and you can compare your options based on what each offers. """,gpt-4,human
""" Mortgages and home equity loans are both secured by property, the collateral for the loan. Mortgages are used to fund the purchase of a property, whereas home equity loans are used to tap existing home equity, converting it to cash to be used at your discretion. While they're both loans used in relation to your house, they're two different financial products. Let's break down some of their similarities and differences. Similarities between mortgages and home equity loans Both use property as collateral to secure the loan. Both allow you to borrow a relatively large amount. Both tend to have lower interest rates compared to other types of credit. Both have qualifying criteria, such as minimum credit score. Both have a significant underwriting process. Differences between mortgages and home equity loans A mortgage helps you buy a home, while a home equity loan helps you pay for other expenses after you buy it. Mortgages have lower interest rates than home equity loans. Mortgages can have fixed or adjustable rates, while home equity loans typically have fixed rates. Mortgages are in the first lien position , while home equity loans are in the second or subsequent position. Home equity loans have lower closing costs than mortgages. How does a home equity loan work? A home equity loan comes later in the homeownership journey, while you’re still paying your mortgage or if you’ve already paid it off. If you’re in the middle of repaying your mortgage, a home equity loan is a type of second mortgage that allows you to use the equity in your home to borrow more money. Bankrate insight: What is a HELOC and how does it work? A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is like a home equity loan in that it allows you to tap into your home equity. However, instead of receiving it in a lump sum upfront, a HELOC lets you draw from a line of credit, like you would with a credit card. Let’s say your home is worth $300,000, and you owe $125,000 on your first mortgage. You have $175,000 of equity in your home, and you can use that equity as the collateral for a loan. You can usually borrow up to 80 percent of your equity, depending on your credit profile, the lender you work with and other factors. To qualify for a home equity loan , you’ll generally need to have at least 20 percent equity, along with a credit score in the mid-600s and an acceptable debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. “These variables can change depending on whether the home is the primary residence or an investment property and whether the borrower is applying alone or with a co-borrower,” says Vikram Gupta, head of home equity for PNC Bank . How does a mortgage work? A mortgage is a loan to help you to finance a home. As with home equity loans, mortgage lenders have requirements you need to meet to be approved for a loan. These typically involve: A minimum credit score that shows a history of responsible payments A debt-to-income (DTI) ratio that shows you earn enough money to cover other expenses such as a car loan or credit card bill A minimum down payment Enough cash to cover closing costs on the mortgage The most common type of mortgage is a 30-year fixed-rate loan, but there are other options for borrowing money for a home, too, such as 15-year fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate mortgages. Which loan type is best for you? The answer depends on what you need the loan for. To narrow it down, ask yourself these questions: Are you buying a home? If yes, and you're not paying in cash, you'll need a mortgage. Do you own a home and want money for other purposes? If yes, you can use a home equity loan to take money out of your equity. Other options include a cash-out refinance and a HELOC. FAQ on home equity loans and mortgages How do tax deductions compare between home equity loans and mortgages? You can deduct interest on your mortgage and your home equity loan, but only if your home equity loan is used to buy, build or improve your existing property. If this applies, you can deduct interest on up to $750,000 of combined debt (your mortgage plus the home equity loan) if married filing jointly, or up to $375,000 for single filers. Is a home equity loan a second mortgage? A home equity loan is a second mortgage. This means that the loan was taken out after the first mortgage, and is therefore in a “junior” or “subordinate” lien position. In the event of a foreclosure sale, the first lien holder (the lender you got your first mortgage from) receives their share of the proceeds first, followed by the second lien holder (the lender you got your home equity loan from) and so on. Second and subsequent lien holders are in a riskier position because there’s a chance they might not recoup all of what they’re owed. What is a reverse mortgage and how does it compare to a home equity loan? A reverse mortgage taps your equity gradually and delivers it in the form of a monthly payment over time. The reverse mortgage doesn't have to be paid back until the homeowner dies or moves. Most reverse mortgages require the borrower to be 62 or older, and are designed to supplement retirement income. Home equity loans, on the other hand, deliver the home equity in a lump sum upfront and are paid back starting immediately after closing, usually for a term of 10 to 30 years. Unlike reverse mortgages, they have no age requirement. """,gpt-4,human
""" Key takeaways Banks and credit unions typically offer the lowest rates and have flexible repayment periods Online lenders specialize in quick funding, often getting cash to you the next day Short-term loans tend to have higher interest rates and fees that could make it harder to pay off a loan Short-term business loans, typically those with repayment periods lasting 18 to 24 months, are a useful tool for companies that need cash quickly . Some lenders offer flexible short-term loans with the most favorable rates and terms, while others may provide fast funding in as little as one to three days. If you’re in the market for a short-term loan, there are a few places to look. Banks and credit unions A bank or credit union typically offers the lowest rates and has flexible repayment periods. This includes term loans where you can choose a short repayment period of 12 months or opt for a longer repayment period, usually up to 60 months. This flexibility gives you more control to decide how you manage your loan and your cash: You can pay off a loan early and save interest, or you can choose to budget payments over a longer period, which may give you breathing room to ensure you have enough cash on hand to cover all of your business’s obligations. When it comes to disadvantages, not all banks and credit unions offer short-term options on their loans. And they generally aren’t the fastest lenders out there. Some lenders may require you to apply over the phone or in person, and the extensive underwriting processes could mean you won’t see funds for at least a week once you apply. So, this isn’t the best choice if you need a fast business loan . Banks that offer short-term business loans If you’re looking for a short-term loan from a traditional bank, here are four top options. Online lenders If you’re looking for a loan or business line of credit with the fastest possible application, approval and funding timeline, an online lender might be better. These lenders specialize in quick funding, often getting cash to you the next day. Online lenders also tend to offer more alternative financing options, like merchant cash advances or invoice factoring . These are accessible loans that may provide access to funds to business owners who may not qualify for loans from banks or credit unions, like startups and business owners with bad credit . The downside is that online lenders with low credit score requirements and open to new businesses tend to offer lower loan amounts. Their loans also tend to have higher interest rates and fees and shorter repayment periods that could make it harder to pay off a loan. Compare unsecured business loans from online lenders If you’re not sure where to look, here is a sample of top online lenders offering unsecured business loans Pros and cons of short-term business loans Consider the pros and cons of short-term business loans before applying for one. Pros Fast funding. Many short-term loans have quick applications and fast funding. You can get the cash you need as soon as the next day. Quick repayment. With a short-term loan, you’ll be out of debt relatively quickly. Low minimums. Short-term lenders often have low minimums, meaning you can borrow a small amount if you don’t need a big loan. Cons Higher rates and fees. Short-term loans tend to carry higher rates than long-term loans. Factor rates. Some online lenders, especially those offering alternative financing options to high-risk borrowers, use factor rates to determine the cost of a loan. These can be confusing compared to interest rates and make it harder to compare loan options. Frequent payments. Most loans come with monthly payments, but some short-term lenders expect weekly or even daily repayment, which could be hard to afford. Bankrate insight Before signing a short-term loan agreement , be sure you fully understand your repayment terms. Using a business loan calculator can help you understand what you can comfortably afford and the full cost of your loan. Alternatives to short-term business loans If a short-term loan doesn’t sound right, here are some alternatives : Long-term loans. These have repayment periods of 60 months or longer. These are best if you need to borrow money for more than a few years or finance larger purchases. SBA loans. The U.S. Small Business Administration insures these loans. SBA loans offer borrowing limits in excess of $5 million and long repayment terms. Alternative financing. Some alternative loans, like merchant cash advances , are short-term options. Others, like crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending, are better for longer-term borrowing and offer perks like minimal credit requirements. Business credit cards. If you can pay your balance off each month, the best business credit cards let you borrow money without interest charges. Other perks may include sign-up bonuses and rewards. Bottom line Short-term business loans can help your company take advantage of a business opportunity or come up with funds quickly during a cash crunch. If you need funds quickly, look to online lenders. If you have a bit more time, a bank or credit union will likely have cheaper loan options. Frequently asked questions How do short-term business loans work? Short-term business loans tend to work like any other loan, giving you cash that you have to repay, plus interest. But these loans are paid off quickly, within six to 18 months. Depending on the lender and type of loan, you may have to repay the loan weekly, biweekly or monthly. Is it hard to get a short-term business loan? If you’ve been in business for at least six months, have reasonable credit and can show that your business is generating revenue, many online lenders offer short-term loans. Just be ready to provide a personal guarantee when applying for the loan. That reduces the lender’s risk in case you default . What is the difference between short- and long-term business loans? The main difference between short- and long-term business loans is how long the repayment period is. Short-term loans usually have repayment periods of 24 months or less. Long-term loans have longer repayment periods, often 60 months or longer. """,gpt-4,human
""" Anyone who’s spent more money than what’s available in their checking account has likely been charged with either an overdraft fee or a nonsufficient funds (NSF) fee. Many believe the two terms are synonymous, yet there are significant differences. Let’s take a look at the main differences between overdraft and NSF fees, as well as ways you can avoid being hit with them. Key takeaways An overdraft fee may be charged by a bank when it temporarily covers transactions that overdraw your account, allowing one or more to clear. An NSF fee is what some banks impose when they decline payments or the cashing of checks that would bring the account to a negative balance. The average overdraft fee is $26.61 and the average NSF fee is $19.94, Bankrate recently found. While overdraft and NSF fees are generally on the decline, they’re still charged by 91 percent and 70 percent of checking accounts, respectively, as surveyed by Bankrate. What is an overdraft fee? An overdraft fee is often charged by a bank when it allows transactions to go through that would otherwise have overdrawn your account. It can be viewed as a temporary loan from the bank, with the customer expected to pay back the amount the bank covered as well as the overdraft fee. Overdraft fees can be significant, but some consumers prefer them over the embarrassment of having a check bounce or debit transactions declined. How much do overdraft fees cost? The average overdraft fee in 2023 is $26.61, according to Bankrate’s checking and ATM fee study . This is down 11 percent from $29.80 in the previous year. While overdraft fees are generally on the decline, they’re still charged by 91 percent of checking accounts surveyed by Bankrate. Many banks impose limits on the number of overdraft fees they will charge to an account in a single day. For example, a bank’s policy may be to charge a customer a maximum of three such fees per day. If the bank then allows four of a customer’s transactions to clear on an overdrawn account in one day, the customer will only be charged three fees that day. Example of an overdraft fee Suppose your account has a balance of $75, and you make a $100 debit card transaction for an expense that comes up, such as a car repair. The bank may cover that extra $25 and allow the transaction to go through. In turn, it charges you its standard overdraft fee — let’s say it’s $30 — and also expects you to pay back the $25 that has overdrawn your account. What is an NSF fee? An NSF fee is commonly charged by banks when an account lacks the funds needed to cover a transaction, and the bank doesn’t allow the transaction to go through. The result may be in the form of bounced checks or denied electronic bill payments. How much do NSF fees cost? The average NSF fee is $19.94, which is down 25 percent over the past year, according to Bankrate’s 2023 checking account and ATM fee study. While NSF fees are generally on the decline, it’s worth noting that they’re still commonly charged. In fact, 70 percent of accounts still charge these fees, Bankrate found. Example of an NSF fee Say you write a check to your landlord for $600, yet your checking account only has a balance of $500. When your landlord attempts to cash the check, the bank doesn’t allow the check to go through and charges you an NSF fee as a result. NSF fees may also apply to electronic payments . Suppose your $100 car insurance payment is debited from your account every month, and you only have $50 in the account on the day the automatic payment is to be made. Your bank may deny the transaction and charge you an NSF fee. In addition to your being hit with an NSF fee from the bank, having bounced checks and rejected electronic payments can cause you to receive returned check fees, late fees or interest charges from the service provider or credit card company you were attempting to pay. Overdraft fees vs. NSF fees The following chart compares overdraft fees and NSF fees, and lists the circumstances under which banks may charge them: Average fee Transaction allowed to clear? Details Overdraft fees $26.61 Yes The bank covers a transaction that overdraws an account, and a fee is assessed. The customer is expected to pay back the fee as well as the money loaned from the bank. NSF fees $19.94 No The bank denies a transaction that would otherwise overdraw the account, which can result in bounced checks or declined electronic payments. A fee is assessed by the bank. How an overdrawn account can affect your credit When a customer doesn’t deposit money into an overdrawn account to eliminate the negative balance and cover any associated fees, the bank may eventually turn the account over to a collection agency , according to the credit bureau Experian. At this point, it can go onto your credit report. To avoid having an overdrawn checking account adversely impact your credit score, it’s important to pay off the negative balance as soon as possible. Having a conversation with a customer service representative can help you to understand the bank’s policy. Ways to avoid overdraft and NSF fees Overdraft protection: Overdraft protection is a bank service that automatically transfers money from a linked savings account when there’s not enough in your checking account to cover things like debit transactions, checks or electronic payments. Such transfers allow transactions to clear (when there are sufficient funds in the linked account), and you won’t be hit with overdraft or NSF fees — although some banks do assess a fee for overdraft protection transfers. Opting out of overdrafts: You won’t be charged for overdrafts if you tell the bank not to allow them for your account. However, opting out of overdrafts means the bank will simply deny any transactions that would bring your account into a negative balance. Account monitoring: Keeping close tabs on your account balance helps ensure you won’t initiate debits or other transactions that you’re not able to cover. Signing up to receive low-balance alerts from your bank can also prove useful. Finding a bank that doesn’t charge these fees: Some banks still allow for overdrafts but may not always charge customers for them. Banks that have eliminated overdraft fees or NSF fees — or both — include Ally Bank, Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, PNC Bank, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. Some banks also provide customers with a grace period — often around 24 hours — to bring up a negative account balance before overdraft fees are assessed. How much banks earn in overdraft and NSF fees Overdraft fees and NSF fees are on a general decline , yet they still generate significant revenue for many banks. Among banks with assets greater than $1 billion, total overdraft and NSF fee revenue was around $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) . What’s more, the vast majority of banks still assess these fees, with 91 percent of banks charging for overdrafts and 70 percent continuing to charge NSF fees, according to Bankrate’s latest check and ATM fee study. Banks have been urged to lower these fees by the CFPB, which refers to them as “ junk fees ” that can drain Americans’ budgets. Bottom line Overdraft fees and NSF fees are both imposed by banks in different scenarios, with the main difference being one fee is charged when transactions are allowed to clear, while the other is levied when they’re denied. Both fees are often significant ones, so knowing how to avoid them is important in keeping your finances on track. """,gpt-4,human
""" A little more than three years ago, the Federal Reserve removed withdrawal limitations that banks had to enforce on savings accounts. But since then few banks have changed their policies in response. Many high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts still have some restrictions on the number of withdrawals or transfers that can be made. Until April 24, 2020, Regulation D limited account holders to a maximum of six convenient withdrawals and transfers from a savings deposit account per statement cycle. (Savings and money market accounts are considered savings deposit accounts.) Before the restrictions were lifted, unlimited withdrawals from an ATM or a bank teller were permitted from savings deposit accounts. But convenient withdrawals, such as via check or transferring money electronically from a savings deposit account to another account, were limited. List of top banks that eased their limits Bankrate reviewed 67 bank websites to find what withdrawal and transfer limitations were placed on savings or money market accounts. Bankrate found that 43 had limits while 24 didn’t. “They do not want to change these accounts to make them completely transactional because technology these days makes it much easier than it was before to make withdrawals,” says Chris Cole, executive vice president and senior regulatory counsel for the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA). Some banks either permit more than six withdrawals or transfers each statement cycle or don’t track the number of times withdrawals or transfers are made from savings deposit accounts. Among them: Ally Bank: Imposes a limit of 1 0 withdrawals and transfers per statement cycle, according to its website. There's no fee for going over the limit, but the account will be closed if the limit is exceeded on a regular basis. KeyBank: The Key Active Saver account does not impose a limit on the number of withdrawals or transfers per month. [ remove since Union is now U.S. Bank ] Union Bank: Offers unlimited transfers and withdrawals. [Remove]- [ U.S. Bank: The Minneapolis-based bank has no transaction limits and charges no fees for savings withdrawals. [U.S. bank has different transaction limits based on the type of account held.] Among the findings, Bankrate’s review of top banks and credit unions showed that Huntington Bank charges $2 for excess transactions, while BMO Harris, KeyBank , Truist and Zions Bank all charge a $15 fee on at least one of their savings deposit accounts. 2 reasons many banks still limit savings withdrawals and transfers 1. It’s optional for banks — they’re not required to change their limits Banks were able to suspend the six-transfer limit, but they weren’t required to, which is likely the main reason some banks haven’t changed their limits on transfers or withdrawals. 2. It’s not a final rule The removal of limits on withdrawals and transfers from savings deposits was an interim final rule. “[Banks are] still waiting for that final piece — meaning that they’re still waiting for a final rule to be issued by the Fed before they actually implement [changes],” says Heather MacKinnon, vice president of legal at the Wisconsin Bankers Association. Restrictions might be good for encouraging saving Some savers may benefit from having withdrawal and transfer limits on savings deposit accounts. Only about 43 percent of Americans were able to pay a $1,000 emergency bill from savings, according to a Bankrate survey published in January . Knowing that withdrawals are limited may prevent some savers from withdrawing or transferring funds too frequently, helping to keep their savings intact for times when they truly need it.

""" Any time you move to a new address, make sure you change your billing address with your credit card issuer. Why? Two reasons. An accurate credit card billing address helps ensure important card-related mail, such as your monthly credit card statement, is sent to the right place. Secondly, keeping your billing address updated helps protect you from potential identity theft. So, what is your billing address used for? And how can you change your credit card billing address? Let’s take a close look at how billing addresses work, including how to find the billing address of a credit card and how to change your billing address with several major credit card issuers. What is a billing address? What does “billing address” mean? A billing address is an address associated with your credit or debit card account. When you apply for a credit card online , for example, the address you include on your application will become your billing address. A billing address looks just like a street address. It has a street number and name followed by a city, state and ZIP code. If you live in a specific apartment or unit, that information will be included in your billing address as well. What is your billing address used for? Your billing address is the address to which your monthly billing statement is sent—but there’s more to a billing address than just that. Your billing address and your billing ZIP code both play key roles in helping to prevent identity theft. Merchants often require you to include your billing ZIP code during the checkout process, especially if you are making an in-person purchase at a brick-and-mortar retailer. This adds an extra layer of protection to your transaction. There’s no billing ZIP code printed on your credit card—which means if your card gets stolen, the thief will have a hard time using your credit card to make purchases. Your billing address also protects you through the Address Verification System, also known as AVS. If you’re making a purchase that requires you to enter a full billing address (not just a billing ZIP code), AVS will compare the billing address you entered with the billing address associated with your credit card. If the addresses do not match, the transaction will often be declined. How to change your billing address There are four easy ways to change your credit card billing address: Use your credit card issuer’s website or app. Log in to your online account and change the billing address associated with your profile. Call customer support. Call the number on the back of your credit card and request a billing address change. Update your address via mail. Write your new address on the back of the payment coupon that comes with your monthly billing statement and mail it back to your credit card issuer. Update your address in person. Some may prefer to visit a branch in person if there’s a location nearby. If you decide to take this route, speak with a representative and ask them to update your mailing address for you. How to check the billing address for a credit card Here’s what to do if you’re currently asking yourself: “What’s my billing address?” Check the billing address for your credit card by either looking at the address printed on your billing statement or log in to your online banking account and review the billing address associated with your credit card. If you have a bank account that includes a checking account, a credit card and a debit card, making a credit card address change might not automatically change the billing address on your debit card and checking account. Double-check every card and account associated with your bank or credit card issuer to ensure that all of the addresses are updated. Here’s how to change your credit card billing address with several major credit card issuers: How to change your billing address with American Express To submit an American Express change address request, log in to your American Express online account or call customer service at 1-800-528-4800.

""" Mobile wallets have been around for a while, but they’re not always easy to understand (even though they’re very easy to use). When you swipe, tap or insert your credit card into a standard credit card terminal, the card reader collects the information stored on your credit card and uses it to complete the transaction. Paying with your phone works in the same way—it’s just that the credit card information is stored on a phone app instead of a piece of plastic. Are mobile wallets secure? Yes, storing a credit card on your phone is safe. In fact, it’s one of the most secure ways to pay. Phone payment apps use the same security technology as contactless credit cards (the kind you tap instead of swipe), and pay-with-phone transactions use tokenization to mask your actual credit card number during the transaction and protect your card information from being stolen. Mobile wallets also let you add multiple credit cards on your phone, which is good for people who want to maximize their credit card rewards by using different cards at different retailers. You can even use contactless payments on some bus and subway systems . Just tap your smartphone to the turnstile, and the credit card on your phone will take care of the rest. But what do you need to do before you’re ready to make credit card payments with your phone? Here’s a step-by-step guide for three of the most popular mobile wallet apps: Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. Apple Pay If you’re an iPhone user, here’s how to use Apple Pay: First, you have to add your credit cards to Apple Pay . Open the Wallet app on your iPhone, tap the plus sign and follow the instructions to add a new credit card to Wallet. Once you’ve added the card, your bank or card issuer will verify the card. From there, you can begin using the verified credit card on Apple Pay. First, unlock your iPhone. If you have a newer iPhone that has Face ID, double-click the side button. Then you’ll be asked to authenticate via Face ID or entering your passcode. If your iPhone has Touch ID, rest your finger on the sensor. Then, select the card you’d like to use (you can choose a default card during setup) and hold your unlocked phone over the contactless credit card reader. Once the payment goes through, you’ll see a “done” icon on your phone screen. Paying with your Apple Watch You can also pay with your Apple Watch. If you’ve completed the Apple Pay setup process on your phone and have your watch connected to your phone, it’s simple. Just double-click the side button on your watch. Your default card will appear first, but you can scroll down and choose another card. When you have the right card selected, just hold your watch near the reader. You’ll feel a tap when the payment is complete. Google Pay If you have an Android phone and want to use Google Pay , begin by adding at least one credit card to the Google Pay app. Use the app to take a photo of your credit card or enter the information manually.

You may be wondering this: Is it bad to close a credit card? While closing a credit card account may not have a significant impact on your credit score , it could cause your score to drop temporarily—even if your account is in excellent standing. Closing a credit card can reduce your overall available credit, which could cause your credit utilization ratio—which counts for 30 percent of your FICO score—to increase. Additionally, the length of your credit history makes up 15 percent of your FICO score, and closing an account can eventually shorten that history. But credit card accounts in good standing remain on your credit report for 10 years. For these reasons, many experts suggest keeping old credit card accounts open, even if you’re not using them. Options to consider before canceling your Amex credit card If you were initially wondering how to close your American Express credit card account but you’re considering the alternatives , here are a few moves you could make instead. Put your card away for safekeeping If you have an Amex credit card that doesn’t charge an annual fee, then you can always stash it away in a safe or a sock drawer. Your account can keep adding depth and history to your credit report that way, and it won’t hurt your credit if you don’t use the card. If you do decide to stash your card away and don’t log into your account page frequently, you should take the time to set up account alerts. That way, you’ll know right away if someone tries to use your card number for a fraudulent purchase, and you can call in to report it. Request a product change Also, know that American Express may let you switch to a different credit card without closing your account. This is called a product change , and it’s a common move for consumers who want to get away from credit cards that charge an annual fee. Just know that you can only upgrade or downgrade your Amex card to another option that earns the same type of rewards. If you have a card that earns American Express Membership Rewards points but charges an annual fee, for example, you can switch to a card that earns the same type of points (instead of cash back) without an annual fee. Closing an Amex credit card: FAQ If you’re still thinking of closing your account, these frequently asked questions and answers can aid in the process. Can I close an Amex credit card with an outstanding balance? You can close an American Express credit card with an outstanding balance. Just remember that you’ll need to continue making payments until your account is paid in full. Can American Express still charge me interest on a closed account? American Express will continue charging interest on your closed credit card account until your balance is paid in full. If you want to pay down your debt without any interest charges, you may want to look into a balance transfer credit card that offers an introductory 0 percent APR for a limited time. What will happen to my Membership Rewards points? If you close your American Express credit card account and you have rewards in your account, you will forfeit your points balance. However, you can get around this if you have another American Express credit card that offers the same type of rewards. For example, you could cancel your American Express® Gold Card without losing your American Express Membership Rewards points, so long as you also have an open Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express account. The bottom line You can close a credit card account any time you want, but you should think over the advantages and disadvantages before you do. It’s possible keeping your old account open could be a boon for your credit, and you could always consider a product change instead of account closure. Whatever you do, make sure your decision to keep or close your credit card account is an informed one. """,gpt-4,human
""" When shopping for a large purchase, like a car, it’s not surprising that consumers want to find the best deals. When trying to budget for a vehicle, you probably consider the overall price, especially if you plan to get a loan. You might also consider the resale value and the fuel efficiency, given the higher cost of gasoline. But not everyone considers insurance costs. Some vehicles cost more to insure than others and over time, insurance rates can add up. Bankrate assessed auto insurance rates for the most popular car models to determine the cheapest cars to insure. The 10 cheapest cars to insure The cost to buy a new vehicle has skyrocketed since 2020, although used vehicle prices have started to fall since their peak in 2021. With inflation still elevated and car insurance rates rising to keep pace, you may be wondering if cheap car insurance could help offset some of these increased prices. While buying a different vehicle to get cheaper car insurance may seem like a drastic step, it could be a practical one, especially if you’re already in the market for a new or new-to-you ride. Below, we showcase the 10 cheapest vehicles to insure based on our assessment of average rates for 27 vehicle makes and models. For comparison, the national average cost of car insurance is $2,014 per year for full coverage. We’ve included the average full coverage premium, as well as the starting manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP), for each vehicle (remember that the MSRP will vary based on the trim package and optional features). We also highlight the percentage of the MSRP spent on car insurance, so you can decide if the average premium makes sense for the cost of the car, especially when compared to your financial situation.

Maybe you have your heart set on a fuel-efficient car to reduce your carbon footprint, an SUV with room for mountain bikes and camping gear, or a truck to haul lumber for yard and home projects. Rest assured, while it may take a bit more research, you can find cheap car insurance no matter what type of vehicle you’re looking for. Below, you’ll find the cheapest vehicles to insure broken down by cars, SUVs and trucks. Keep in mind, though, that “cheap” is a relative term.

It’s probably clear by now that different vehicles cost different amounts to insure, but you may be wondering why. Why are some of the makes and models above higher than the national average, and some are below? What makes a vehicle cheaper or more expensive, on average, to insure? It all boils down to risk. Insurers determine what premiums to charge based on the risk of claims being filed and the potential severity of those claims. Several factors go into this assessment. For example, a vehicle that costs more to repair or replace will likely have a higher premium, since those features make a claim more expensive. A vehicle with a higher likelihood of accidents, like a sports car , would also likely have a higher premium. Sometimes, an older, cheaper vehicle without modern safety features can also have high repair costs, which can lead to heftier car insurance rates . On the flip side, some higher-priced cars might have features like automatic braking, which can help avoid or lessen the severity of crashes. Features like those might lower your premium. Some attributes of a vehicle that can affect the premium are: Age : The older the car, the cheaper it might be to insure compared to newer models due to a lower repair or replacement cost. However, older cars also tend to lack updated safety features, which can lower premiums on the cars that have them. Size: Bigger, heavier vehicles may be more capable of causing more damage on the road, leading to a higher auto insurance premium. Trim level: Upgraded features in a vehicle affect the purchase price and the cost of insurance. Safety features: Safety features in a vehicle minimize the risk of collision and theft and are often associated with lower insurance premiums. High-end or luxury cars: The overall cost of these vehicles is higher than standard vehicles, and so are the costs for repairs, parts and labor, all of which drive up insurance rates. Cars with specialty parts: Due to the cost and difficulty of repairing or replacing parts after an accident, these vehicles might be more expensive to insure. Vehicles with low safety ratings: These vehicles may be more likely to be involved in accidents, and those accidents may be more severe, leading to a higher claim payout. The higher risk leads to a higher rate. Car insurance rates are complex, so there’s no sure-fire way to know how much you’ll pay for a given car until you request quotes from a few companies. Cars with more expensive car insurance If you’re in the market for a new or used vehicle and are specifically looking for something with cheap car insurance rates, there are certain makes and models you may want to avoid. We’ve listed out the five most expensive vehicles to insure, based on our research, below. However, keep in mind that while a vehicle’s make and model does affect rates, insurance companies use several other factors when determining premiums. The best way to know how much your vehicle will cost to insure is to get multiple quotes. Vehicle Average annual full coverage premium MSRP Insurance as % of MSRP Dodge Charger $2,824 $31,125 9.07% Tesla Model Y $2,804 $39,990 7.01% Mercedes C300 $2,753 $41,600 6.62% Cadillac Escalade $2,743 $76,195 3.60% Tesla Model 3 $2,577 $44,990 5.73% Tips to get a cheaper car insurance rate If you are specifically looking for cheap car insurance, know there are plenty of ways to lower your rate . Some steps you may want to consider taking: Think about your vehicle choice: As you’ve seen, insurance costs vary widely depending on the vehicle you buy. A Subaru Outback costs 43 percent less to insure than a Dodge Charger , for example. If you’re looking for a different vehicle, you may want to shop with an eye toward insurance costs. Get multiple quotes: Car insurance companies rate risk differently, meaning that the cost of car insurance varies between insurers, even for the same coverage and vehicle. Shopping around helps you compare rates and find the most competitive price. Utilize discounts: Car insurance discounts are an easy way to lower your rate, and most major insurers offer at least a few. Taking advantage of as many discounts as you qualify for may help lower your rate. Keep a clean driving record: Moving violations, at-fault accidents and major violations like DUI convictions all significantly impact your premium. If you can avoid these incidents, you’ll likely be able to keep your rate lower than those with marks on their driving records. Frequently asked questions What is the average cost of car insurance?
